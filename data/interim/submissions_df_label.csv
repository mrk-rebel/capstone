s7yara,"I‚Äôve been replaying this conversation I had with my dad a few months ago and it keeps making me more and more sick to my stomach. I was talking about the Jeffrey Epstein case with my SO and my dad overheard and joined the conversation. He said that Epstein should never have been charged with a crime and all the girls were just money hungry whores. I told him that some of the girls were as young as 12 and he said ‚Äúso what? Girls can be whores at any age‚Äù. After I told him how disgusting that is, I asked him what he thinks the age of consent should be and he told me that if a girl is old enough to say yes to sex then she‚Äôs old enough to deal with the repercussions. 

He also bragged to me about a paper he wrote during his one year of law school before he dropped out about how girl‚Äôs sexual history should be able to be used against them in rape cases. He told me that in every other criminal case you can use someone‚Äôs criminal history against them. I told him that having consensual sex isn‚Äôt a crime and he told me ‚Äúmaybe being a slut should be a crime‚Äù. I asked him if he would believe me if I told him I had been sexually assaulted and he told me I‚Äôd have to have some sort of proof. Like I get needing proof in cases of people you don‚Äôt know, but I‚Äôve never had issues with lying and I‚Äôm literally his own daughter.

Him treating me like shit definitely isn‚Äôt out of the norm, but the blatant sexism caught me off guard. I was definitely the scapegoat child while my brothers were treated way differently. He used all sorts of sexist names to insult me like slut, whore, bitch. I never even considered before that he might actually just be a sexist. Just for the record, he never sexually abused me or anyone else that I know of. He also treated my mom much better than me, too. Maybe it‚Äôs young women/girls he has the issue with? Idk I just feel like if you have such an issue with either gender, you shouldn‚Äôt have kids. You have a 50/50 shot of having a kid that you can‚Äôt stand. 

Not sure if this is just part of him being a narc and thinking he‚Äôs better than everyone else and therefore men are better than women, or if it‚Äôs more of a hatred towards women. Did anyone else have a parent that seemed to target you because of your gender?",My dad defended Jeffrey Epstein and said that age of consent laws shouldn‚Äôt exist.,1.0,2.0

s7va9j,"The title is worded weirdly I couldn‚Äôt think of a better way to phrase it sorry

Why I‚Äôm skeptical:

Anyways last year I was pregnant. I only got two weeks paid maternity leave and was having our baby just after tax season so it worked out perfectly. Use my taxes to substitute the remainder of my leave ect. It ended up being a nice size return so I had it directly placed into our checking account and whatever was left over I would put in savings. Well my fianc√© was under the impression that we absolutely needed a minivan now that we had a third kid so unbeknownst to me he put his perfectly running suv for sale so he‚Äôd get my car and get me a minivan. Fine whatever just make sure it runs. He find the ‚Äúperfect‚Äù minivan and signed off on the sale receipt and it doesn‚Äôt shift gears. 

Including tow and repairs he sank my whole tax return into a van that ends up getting totaled in a crash a month later! The insurance cuts us a check for $3,000 and I mentioned getting another side of the road car a smaller one that way we don‚Äôt have to worry about car payments (which my car had) and call it a day. Due to previous events he absolutely insists on getting a dealership car! We budget it out and was able to get it to work go get a car with the check and went on with our lives. Never got a minivan just another suv so it was pointless to sell his but that was all behind us. I needed a car to go back to work so my hands were tied! 

Fast forward to now: 

Fianc√© regrets getting a second car note. It fits into our budget nicely but like any other bill that money could go towards somewhere else. This year I‚Äôm getting another sizable tax return (apparently my last stimulus wasn‚Äôt the right amount so Im getting more due to that) I was going to put half into savings so we can move and use the other half for bills and things for the kids/the house. I told my fianc√© about my plans hoping he‚Äôd be excited to finally get some substantial savings. He wasn‚Äôt in fact he was quite irritated that none of that money can go towards paying off the cars. I told him the savings will help if heaven forbid there‚Äôs a month we couldn‚Äôt pay on the cars or any other bill and that if he wanted to pay off a chunk of the cars he can use his tax return! 

I‚Äôm tired of a sick day putting us behind I want to start a decent saving account for a peace of mind. Not for a stupid car!",SO wants to use my tax return I already have plans for,2.0,2.0

Men are supposed to get rejected a lot, jestermaxx, and pay for stuff. It's basically some kind of Jane Austen script where ""many suitors"" compete for an average girl. [I never actually read Jane Austen, I just watched the movie]. 

The goal of normie culture is to have Men pay as much as possible for mediocre women. It should be obvious that Men are not going to get sex in this culture, even if they marry. 

If you compare this with counter-cultures such as tradcon, BDSM, or punting, where sex is considered a right for Men, then it's obv that the problem (for Men) is cultural.

ruuyy4,"Since the cunnilingus episode in our apartment building's staircase today which I posted about earlier, I've been pretty horny and so has boyfriend, although he spent the night playing video games. When it's bedtime, I was looking at my phone before realizing that he didn't have his boxer on. 

He had been sleeping entirely naked since the building's heat was turned on for the winter, but I sucked him good and made him come so often at bedtime that he started to put his boxers back on just to get some sleep, much to my disappointment. His not having his boxes on tonight was clearly a sign that I could suck his cock again. 

Which I did and I did it well. Before long he was moaning and begging me to suck on his nipples while I stroked him as he had to pull his cock out of my mouth and let me use my hands when it got too sensitive. I'd been practicing deep throat recently and could now take much of his pretty cock into my mouth (his huge cock that always stuffs me good and that we have to use extra large condoms for), and I begged him to finger my drenched cunt while I sucked him. He's so fucking hot when moaning from having his cock sucked and calling me a little whore in heat.

For some reason he's hell bent on not coming even though in the end he had been so on edge that he had to pull his cock out of my mouth or my hands as soon as I started to suck or stroke his cock again. I begged him to please fuck me - I was soaking wet - promising that I'd do all the riding so that he could just lay back and relax and he refused. I was furious in a good way, and as I doubled down on my sucking he started to come a little - just a little to make me smell his cum and he pressed kisses all over my face and whispered to my ear that this was my training for becoming his cum slut (I don't like the smell and would always rush to spit it out or rinse my mouth after he has come in my mouth). 

In the end he just pushed me away and asked me to rub one out and flopped onto the bed to sleep, cause he preferred to keep himself on edge. But as I resigned myself to not being able to come on his big cock this time he suddenly said that I wasn't a real slut as I appeared to be - real sluts would kill for cum - but that he'd make sure I get the training I needed to become one.

I'm curious and excited to know where this will lead us to. We've been together for almost 8 years now and it's only recently that sex between us has taken a more kinky turn. We're also in an open relationship, but I haven't had other cocks in almost 5 years now. When we first got together I was fucking so many other people which I still masturbate to. Then life got busy, I got lazy, and was content to just have his cock, although I do dream of having other cocks in my holes again some time in the future.",Edging my (29F) boyfriend (30M) at bedtime,1.0,2.0

sgmy75,"For those who don't know, demisexual means that one only experiences sexual attraction to someone with whom they have a romantic/emotional connection. 

A lot of people just fail to acknowledge that male and female sexuality is very different, and that women, on average, are simply not as horny as men are. There are *some* women with libidos comparable to men, but they're only attracted to super hot men. 

That's why there are a lot more men than women on dating sites like Tinder and OkCupid. That's why women don't ""pursue"" sex with men they've just men; rather, they tend to express lust once a romantic connection has been established. Men and women have very different sexualities.",Most women are demisexual.,2.0,2.0

s2d199,"My girlfriend and I dated for a little over a year. I hadn‚Äôt dated before so she was my first relationship.  I was also a virgin before her so she was first sexual partner as well.  Call me a late bloomer, loser, etc.  I really don‚Äôt care, I heard it all before.  and Everything started off fine but eventually, I grew tired of this one problem in the relationship.  Turns out she has been with 13 guys before me.  Some were relationships, some were hookups.  Call me judgemental all you want but I consider 13 to be alot.  I tried to look past it but it I couldn‚Äôt get over it.  I didn‚Äôt want to date someone who had had sex with 13 guys before.  It kinda turns me off. I tried to get therapy and other means of help but nothing was working.  I decided it was best to break things off with her and tell her why.   I told her that while I think she‚Äôs a good person, I don‚Äôt feel comfortable dating her because she‚Äôs been with too many people.  I thought it was best to be honest about why I wanted to end the relationship.  You can call it slut shaming or whatever you‚Äôd like but end the end of the day, it‚Äôs my life and I get to choose what I‚Äôm comfortable with.

s0lkli,"Cassie was a fan favorite last season because she was a beautiful and sweet girl. She represented the downsides of being the prettiest girl in town: being over sexualized, slut shamed, and treated like an object rather than a person. We also got to explore her dysfunctional family dynamic: an alcoholic mother, absentee addict father, and a resentful sister. All of this ultimately contributed to her need for male validation.


But as tragic  as her character may be, I feel like a lot of Cassie stans are avoiding a difficult realization: Cassie is‚Ä¶kinda a bad person. This love triangle isn‚Äôt a one off situation. She spent the entirety of last season cheating on her boyfriend then feeling guilty about it. We thought her abortion (which was her right to have) would be a pivotal moment for her character‚Ä¶.But she starts off season two making WORSE decisions than last time.

Nate was TRIPLE off limits. He‚Äôs your best friends on-again/off-again boy-friend (strike one). Said boyfriend ABUSED your best friend (strike two), and to make it all worse, he‚Äôs McKay‚Äôs best friend (strike three).

I hate the ‚ÄúNate took advantage of her‚Äù discourse. Nate is a horrible person so no one expects him to have a moral compass. Regardless, Cassie knew EXACTLY what she was doing. Taking her panties off in the car, saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm soaking wet,‚Äù SHE seduced him (Nate isnt shit for even thinking about it). Then when they were in the bathroom she looked happy as hell‚Ä¶ But moment Maddy banged on the door she couldn‚Äôt stop crying. She KNEW she fucked up. I‚Äôm tired of the excuses for her.

I want her to get help because I do like her character and she‚Äôs experienced a lot of trauma. However, being traumatized isn‚Äôt an excuse to be an asshole to others. You‚Äôre not responsible for *being* traumatized, but you are responsible for how you deal with it.",Holding Cassie accountable for her actions.,2.0,2.0

He told me that he‚Äôs into being a dominant guy during sex. And that made me feel like I could tell him about my kinks. 

I feel like what I like isn‚Äôt crazy. I like pretty basic rough stuff like choking, slapping, spanking, hair pulling, etc. He said he liked all those things. But yesterday, he admits to me that he lied. He said he likes normal sex and he doesn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs normal for a man to beat on a woman in any context, even if she likes it. I guess I see his point.

He told me that he would never wanna treat me like that. He was hesitant to say something so I had to force it out of him. He goes like, ‚Äúthe stuff you like are what sluts like‚Äù. And that hurt a lot. I had to hang up for a second to restrain myself from crying. I called him back and we got to talking. He told me that he doesn‚Äôt think he can hit me the way I want him to.

I told him it‚Äôs not a problem and Id be okay with vanilla sex. And I‚Äôm not even 100% sure I am. I think I‚Äôd always want it. I guess I mainly like vanilla sex though. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll be a huge problem as long as he gets me there.

I was briefly introduced to him by my ex at a party when we still were together. They had become very close friend and soon we broke up because of him.

Now, I feel inferior to the guy. She chose him over me after a year of being together. He's taller, probably 40 pounds heavier than me and could probably kick the shit out of me. He's probably very outgoing and extroverted. 

What should I do if I meet him? I feel like I should fight with him, I know that it would not be the right answer, and he would beat me. Should I ignore him? Stay away from him? I don't really like the idea of running away. 

I feel like as a male I either fight with him and show I'm not a coward or I don't and show I'm inferior, scared and a loser. I hope some of you guys can give me some perspective.

A 24 year old female tech worker made a tik tok showing off her fancy office and upper class life. Half the comments on that post were about how she probably didn‚Äôt get the job for her skills. Low level corporate jobs are full of young people, and this sub LOVES praising the 24 year old dudes with these jobs because y‚Äôall rightfully acknowledge that they are workers too. But when the young white collar worker is a pretty blonde girl, all of that evaporates and not only do we hate her and hold her accountable for Uber‚Äôs abuses of their drivers, but she must‚Äôve only been hired for her ass anyway. 

That girl probably makes $90k tops in an expensive city. She is not the enemy for having a nice job, a pleasant office environment, or wealthy parents who are likely subsidizing that fancy apartment. You have no reason to assume she is not good at her job. 

It was one thing when I‚Äôd catch bits of misogyny here and there directed at female managers. That was easy to ignore and write off as poorly worded anger. But now you are turning this bullshit on a fellow worker and it‚Äôs clear some of you just hate women.

EDIT: this got a lot of responses and I don‚Äôt have a ton of time right now, but thank you to everyone leaving supportive comments and giving this post awards. Please don‚Äôt spend your money on Reddit though. I‚Äôm glad to see that the prevailing attitude of this sub is still that that bullshit is unacceptable.

To address all the downvoted comments en masse: I am not the one dividing the movement by posting this. The people being openly and flagrantly bigoted and turning off large swaths of the population from getting involved are the ones doing that, and as you can see in the comments, a lot of people were thinking the same thing. The existence of that attitude is the problem, starting a discussion about the problem is not the problem.

rtrvyp,"First of all, he wasn't anything before. I didn't turn him gay, I made him gay.


I have a blog where I post stories I write in my free time and random people check them out and lately I've been working on a fantasy series, something similarvto Game of Thrones. And yeah, long story short I made a fan favorite gay and everyone started accusing me of gay propaganda and I had no reason to do that and ""I' trying to capitalize on communities"" and ""earn unnecessary diversity points"" or something.


Did I have a reason to do that? No. Did I need one? Also, no. It's my story, done in my free time because it's as relaxing for me to write I think it is for you to read it. I don't get why some of them are so mad, I can stop posting them altogehter, if you don't like it, stop reading it.


And it wasn't even an explicit sex scene, it was just an emotional train of thought said character had after talking to some other guy. I didn't even say ""love"" or anything, I just kinda hinted at it. Kinda. 


And look, I get it. I don't like it either when shows or movies throw in unlikable/dumb lgbt characters for no actual reason except to claim diversity, and then expect the viewers to like them just for that but this is not the case. People love him. He has a great character arc, and they really went from wishing him a horrendous death to putting him on a pedestal. 


I just thought he needed some emotion. Some other emotion than ""I am sorry for my wounded men and will do everything in my power to return them safe to their families"" or ""I will die before my country does"". I wanted to add something more personal, something that was for him and him alone, not for anyone else. You know, trying to crack the surface of that ""all business"" persona, letting some light go through the cracks. Just this time, nothing crazy. Adds to the character.


I explained this to my readers and they went ""yEaH bUt wHy gAy?"" Because. Why not? I don't have an answer for that, he maybe bisexual for all I know. He may just care too much about a man he admires. Maybe he wants to be friends with the guy. Who knows? I didn't even mention any sexual thoughts because I don't want him to that. Like never. I literally left it up to the reader. 


And then some others argued that gay feelings don't match up with a ""leader of men"". I didn't make him suck dick in front of the whole army ffs! It was just about some random thoughts! Characters complexity and all that! 


And you know what pisses me off the most? I was never an lgbt advocate, but I literally described this guy as a kid beating a slave to death in the earlier parts of the story (hence the character arc) and they were never so outraged. Were they kinda mad? Yeah. But they got over it because it's just a fucking fictional story in a fictional world wrote by someone who has too much free time. Now however? Nah, no way, this is personal, let's take it to the comments and call the writer names and let him know how much he sucks anyway.


I kinda lost all my will to continue with it ngl.


Edit: for everyone that wanted to know, I just thought of something to deal with it.


I will have a scene where some man will find his son in bed with some side character who barely showed up until now. It will start as a gay sex scene, just out of spite, as someone of you said, and the (now hompohobe) dad finds them. It causes a commotion and the character I mentioned in the post above will have to deal with it. There will be internal monologue and people shouting. You know, like the mainstream medieval gathering.


That will be it for my great leader of men and his sexuality but it will introduce a new character. Gay and growingly important. Just because I can. I will make him a good hearted man, basically hiving a whole bunch of qualities just to, you know, earn sympathy points. 


And then, I will kill his lover in battle, the son of the homophobe guy. And then, there will be a long scene with both of them crying and screaming side by side, because more than gay or straight, the man was a person, a son, a significant other. 


I can't say I'm doing it to teach people something about love, but if it happens for even one of them to rethink their approach on the matter, it would be wonderful. Hard to hope for that but still. 


And yeah, I'm excited for it, thank you guys. I really love this story and I won't let it die


2nd edit: alright, I get it. Bury your gays is not good and all. But it's not that bad. I will only kill the lover who won't add much to the story except for his death. And idk how many played rdr2 but I' planning to take this character (whose lover dies) on a Sadie Adler path. And it's really not that special, I've done something similar with a straight character whose fiancee died and is now a god killer. 


The dead lover would just be an episodic character, briefly mentioned once every 2 or 3 parts who just happens to be gay. I killed a whole bunch of these characters, gay or not. I genuinely don't think it's anything interesting. The focus would fall entirely on the gay guy who mourns his death. And think of it this way: I can unlock a heck of a lot more gay characters by making him sleep with random people. Like, a lot more gay relationships.


Someone was mad at me, saying I'm ignoring you, I'm not, I was just trying to think things through until I found an optimal solution. I came here for an advice and some sort of support when I felt like giving up and I got a lot of both. 


I'm not a professional writer, I'm just doing this as a hobby, Idon't get any money out of it, all the time and thought I put into it is just for fun. My work won't get published or anything, it's just for a small group of people who happened to have stumbled across my blog.

Someone I loosely know of has been a very silly boy and decided to drink drive. They were in a collision with another vehicle and all four people in the collision have serious, potentially life changing injuries. 

I care not that the driver will face consequences (he should, obviously) but I do want to understand possible offences and what this would mean for him. 

IF his blood tests come back and he was over the drink drive limit, I‚Äôm assuming the minimum he will be getting for that is a 12 month driving ban. 

I‚Äôve had a look [here](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/police-crime-sentencing-and-courts-bill-2021-factsheets/police-crime-sentencing-and-courts-bill-2021-road-traffic-offences-factsheet) and can see 

> There is no specific offence of causing serious injury by careless driving even though injuries caused by careless driving can be wide ranging and may result in permanent and life changing injury.

The social media post put out by the police force states they‚Äôre all seriously injured, so IF the drink driver is found to be at fault, is there any offences of potentially causing serious injury x 3, and what would the outcome of that be? 

Also, would they be charged for the serious injury alongside the drink driving? 

Purely asking for my own interest so anyone that can shed some light will be classed a legend.

Edit: 

[CPS page](https://www.cps.gov.uk/crime-info/driving-offences)

> There are offences of causing serious injury by driving dangerously (section 1A Road Traffic Act 1988) and causing serious injury by driving when disqualified (section 3ZD  Road Traffic Act 1988)

s8lvxz,"I‚Äôve posted my saga on here before and now the inevitable has happened. I told him before the date to go out and have fun, don‚Äôt worry about me. And when he got back, I took one look at him and heat rushed through my whole body and my heart sunk. I feel like I set a trap for him because I told him to do what he wants and then got so upset when he did. I knew I was going to be upset if he had sex, but I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to dictate what he does with someone else. 

He said he‚Äôs willing to pump the breaks on his dates and reconnect, but to me the only option is to just keep feeling this way while he dates someone else. I don‚Äôt want to stop him because I know he wants to be non-monogamous and that being in a monogamous relationship isn‚Äôt what he really wants long-term. Honestly I feel like I‚Äôd rather watch our relationship crumble than ask him to pump the breaks. There‚Äôs someone else‚Äôs emotions involved, and it seems like it would build resentment if I asked him to stop seeing her. 

And the thing is, I feel secure and I know he loves me, I know he‚Äôs not going to leave me. I just really don‚Äôt want him to have sex with other people. Is that bad? What‚Äôs wrong with me? It just feels like our sacred special love space has been infiltrated by someone else‚Äôs energy.

When I think about romance and sex, I only want that with my partner. I have no interest in doing that with someone else because why would I, when I have the perfect version of it already at home? He intrinsically doesn‚Äôt feel the same way about sex, so it feels like we will never both be getting what we want. 

I truly do not know what to do. It feels like my only option is to be miserable with this and try to put on a good face so I don‚Äôt continue to make him feel guilty about it.

I (23f) went on a date with someone that I had met at a coffee shop and we hit it off. We both made it clear that neither of us is looking for a relationship and that if we liked each other, we‚Äôd like a fwb. Im over with having hook ups and putting myself in shady situations, so I wanted to find someone that I can have sex with, and minimize my risk of getting killed or anything. I just want to say I know that night I made a series of bad decisions which Im not proud of, so please dont slut shame me. 
I want back to his place where we started making out and I pulled out a condom out of my purse. Although I have had my fair share of casual sex, I take my sexual health very seriously and have never had sex without condom with people who were not my boyfriend. I asked him to put the condom on which he did and then we started having sex. I was under the influence, not just alcohol, and I made my first stupid mistake when he asked me if he could remove his condom. I dont know why in that moment I agreed to it and rationalized my decision with ‚Äúoh Im not gonna get HIV if this time is the only time I have unprotected sex and that a lot of people never use condom and dont have HIV‚Äù. (I know there are a lot of STDs but my main concern has always been HIV). 
After he finishes, he asks me if I ever had sex with more than one guy at them time and I told him no but I‚Äôve always wanted to, but since it‚Äôs very hard to organize, it never happened. He asked me if Im interested in having it with his friends and I said yes.  I told him that it was very out of character for me to let him fuck me without a condom and that his friends must wear condoms and that Im not gonna take all of that risk. He said that they will and then we went to the hotel. Since I had already had sex with the first guy without a condom, I thought I‚Äôd only let him not use a condom (stupid) but others must wear it. Fast forward, we‚Äôre having sex and one of his friends is trying to convince me to let him take off the condom. I was very firm and told him no, but he continued asking. I explained my reasons to him and told him that Im not gonna put myself in more risk than I already have. I was drunk but making sure at the same time that the other guys are wearing condoms. I would catch them frequently trying to put it in without the condom and would stop them and ask them to wear it. Having sex with more than one guy could be really fun but at the same time it‚Äôs overwhelming and you could lose track of what‚Äôs happening specially when you‚Äôre intoxicated and cant see what they‚Äôre doing while they‚Äôre standing behind you. 
I tried my best to make sure they were wearing it, but as I said there were times I would catch them without the condom and get pissed. One of the friends wanted to fuck me and I saw there is no condom and told him to put it on and he replied : I‚Äôve been fucking you all night with a condom. I got really frustrated and overwhelmed and went to the bathroom and told them that Im tried and want to go to bed. 
Although Im really mad at the whole condom situation, but I gotta say that they were being respectful and would stop if they thought I was in pain or wasn‚Äôt enjoying it and kept asking me if Im okay and want anything. I found out that they have sex with strippers, but they told me that they use protection with them, which Im having a hard time believing since one of them couldn‚Äôt even stay hard with the condom on.The next morning when they dropped me off, I didnt think much about it but decided to go to a clinic and talk to the doctor about PEP, post exposure prophylaxis for HIV. Today when I saw the doctor, he agreed on prescribing it to me specially when I told him about the sex workers. 
I just picked up my medication and Im starting to feel so violated. It wasn‚Äôt rape since I had consented to having sex with them, but the whole situation doesn‚Äôt sit right with me and is making me so uncomfortable and weird. Im happy that Im taking PEP but I know it has a lot of side effects and just feel shitty that I have to go through this because they wouldn‚Äôt listen to me. Idk, I know I made a lot of shitty and bad decisions this weekend, but the whole condom situation feels so wrong and I kinda feel violated? I havent told anyone about the whole condom thing since Im trying to process what happened and also dont want to be told that I brought this on my own by agreeing to sleep with more than one guy. So what do you think? I just feel all over the place and want to cry, I have very important exams this week and Im just hoping that the PEP wouldn‚Äôt make me that sick.

Over the last year prices have skyrocketed due to new buyers coming into the market trying to complete a set of their own, these prices will continue to go up as long as new collectors keep coming into the community.

So now that we've discussed what not to do, now I'll give an alternative.

I am currently in the works of creating a set value calculator, 

the current setup gives each car a Rank (1 Rarest - 10 Common) and splits the value of the whole set between the cars based on their rank. Some time in the next couple weeks I'll be posting the calculator as well as some forms requesting information on what cars you've collected. This will give us real numbers on car rarity that exist in the community and how hard some cars are actually to find.

The thing that makes this calculator better than just knowing the current prices is you can set the value of a set from 50-5000 in intervals of 50 you can see a breakdown on how much you can spend on a car without breaking your set value.

Which means you can use the calculator to in theory buy a set at a predetermined value.

As an added bonus i've collected Rank data on both Acceleracers sets and the World race set, meaning I'll also be collecting collection data on those sets at a later time.

For women celebrities, first off, their breast size, and general body shape, can‚Äôt really be hidden, mostly because that‚Äôs just the way human bodies work. We also seem to get a good amount of information about their sex lives, up to and including the (too common) extremes of their personal photos being stolen and distributed or them being subjected to publicly broadcast illegal voyeurism, in the noble pursuit of crossing a new fap horizon.

And all of this stuff is just widely known, makes tabloid covers if not the pages of more ‚Äúreputable‚Äù publications, and generally belies the inherent entitlement of society to women‚Äôs bodies, but I digress. 

*All of that aside,* PURELY LOGISTICALLY, *how* is it not the case that knowledge about male celebrity penis size (or shape, or disposition, or kemptness of the bush, or whatever) is not more of a thing?

Statistically, celebrities get probably getting laid more than ‚Äúaverage‚Äù. Logistically, they are in the public eye and the details of their personal lives are desperately sought after by huge corporations. Financially, it‚Äôs more lucrative to leak details about a celebrities sex life than to do the same about an average person‚Äôs sex life. And yet my ex still doesn‚Äôt hesitate to tweet about how disappointing I was - so how does information about celebrity men‚Äôs endowment, or whatever, not reach my ears more often?

Yes Jon Hamm and Willem Dafoe. But even those are on the positive side. I legit can‚Äôt remember a story about a working celebrity‚Äôs weird or abnormal or disappointing or funny penis, despite being the type of internet creep that would post this question on reddit.

I legit don‚Äôt get it. Is it bro code all the way up and down? Is there some kind of more substantial (legal or otherwise) reason?

It‚Äôs driving me crazy.","Why isn‚Äôt male celebrity penis size more publicly known, or more of a ‚Äúthing‚Äù?",2.0,2.0

rx1vpv,"We hear about bad leadership all the time, but what's the best you've seen? 

I'll go first: I was on a mobilization and the CO was a very present figure. We had certain events we had to complete every week that were essential to the mobilization and he would be there 98% of the time, sergeant major in tow. They would check in on us that we had all we needed, they would observe from a distance and let us work, and whenever we implemented a new job/task to be done they would be there at least the first iteration to witness it. He actually approached me during an event I was leading and recommended something simple I had overlooked. It wasn't a threatening correction. It really just seemed like he wanted me to have what I needed to succeed. 

Another situation was a SSGT who remained extremely neutral in all dealings with his junior Marines. He would listen to the craziest stories while we were all calling bullshit. He would look at all the facts and dig into it until he was satisfied enough to make a judgement. Sometimes, those crazy stories turned out to be true (or at least believable enough to run with). He didn't just shut people down when he disagreed. A real class act.",What is the best example of leadership you've seen?,2.0,2.0

The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Kathy Hilton weighed in on sister (and co-star) Kyle Richards' ongoing feud with former BFF Lisa Vanderpump during Andy Cohen's podcast SiriusXM's Andy Cohen Live on Jan. 5. 

Host Andy asked if Kathy has ""maintained"" her friendship with Lisa since joining RHOBH, the Bravo reality series that Lisa parted ways with in 2019 following an explosive fight with Kyle. ""Would you say you're seeing each other less?"" Andy questioned Kathy. ""Because you seemed like you guys were friendly for a while...""

Kathy responded, ""We really were. And even when Kyle and I were not. We met Lisa around the same time. I actually may have met her the day before Kyle did, and then we were at a birthday party together. I liked like Lisa very much, but she has not made any effort with me.""

So, does Kathy's affiliation with RHOBH affect her relationship with Lisa?

""I don't know,"" Kathy admitted. ""I mean, I haven't heard from her, but I know she's so busy and I know I'm busy and I used to bump into her lot. We used to be a lot tighter, like maybe three, four years ago. But there's no problem."" 

Kathy and sister Kim Richards voiced their support for Kyle during ""restaurant-gate"" in May 2021 involving allegations of Lisa dining and dashing. Lisa quipped that Kyle ""should keep her new nose out of my business,"" which left Kathy in disbelief. 

""No, [Lisa] would never do that,"" Kathy said at the time. ""Vanderpump loves Kyle. She would never do that."" 

Now, Kathy is instead focused on a friendship with another Lisa: Lisa Rinna, that is.

""Lisa Rinna I've known for 30 years and I love, love, love, love her,"" Kathy gushed about her RHOBH co-star. ""I've also gotten very close with Sutton [Stracke]. She always says we're cut from the same cloth. So Sutton and I have a very tight relationship.""

Kathy added, ""Dorit [Kemsley] is so much fun. PK, I love, love them. And I would say that the one I spend the most time with would probably be Garcelle [Beauvais]. In fact, I'm going to do a week on her show and fill in, so that'll be fun. And I just heard I have to be up at four in the morning!"" 

And since Kathy is officially returning to RHOBH for season 12, we can't wait to see what else she has in store.

se6iye,"It wasn't a work dinner per se but a celebratory dinner  with my colleagues my boss organised to congratulate/thank us for the past year. It was no black tie event but it was at a nicer restaurant and with my boss so there was a certain decorum expected. Partners were allowed so I thought to bring my fianc√©e and she agreed. Lately my fianc√©e has been dressing less conservatively, for lack of a better word, which hasn't really phased me much because whatever but I kind of expected her to dress a bit more appropriately given the setting and company. When I picked her up though, she was dressed in these fishnet stockings, short shorts and a blazer with no shirt/bra underneath. I reminded her that my boss will be there and where we were going and she said it didn't matter. Told her that it wasn't appropriate and that we still had time if she could find something else (if it matters, I was just wearing jeans and a sweater). Long story short she said she wasn't interested in changing and if it bothered me so much I should go alone.

So I went alone. As expected, everyone else was also dressed casually but not too casual. Dinner lasted a couple hours and then I returned home. Fianc√©e was mad that I left without her and said that I was being controlling/wasted her time since she got all dressed up and put on makeup.

I‚Äôm so damn scared of men.


I was first SA‚Äôd when I was 7.

It just keeps happening, regardless of how careful I am.

Friends, family, acquaintances, complete strangers- anyone, ANY MAN could hurt me. 

It‚Äôs happened so many times, I just stay home where it‚Äôs safe. 

Today on live stream I had a full body panic reaction to construction guys walking past my window.

I know I‚Äôm safe, they‚Äôve been working here for months, I‚Äôve never had any trouble.

But one of Them could‚Äôve noticed during this time that I‚Äôm alone. 

That I don‚Äôt have visitors.

I‚Äôm not being unrealistic in being afraid, by my own experiences and all the damn true crime I watch.

I only recently realized I‚Äôm watching true crime to study how other girls got got, try and figure out how to stay a step ahead of Them.

My interest in body language spawned from being on eggshells around my (not diagnosed but I assume) Bipolar1 mother. One year I baked her a birthday cake and she cried, next year she slapped me. I mean, damn. 

Her abuse got me interested in psychology, I was desperate to understand why she didn‚Äôt love me.

The constant SA by men from all walks of life has me wondering what on earth is going on in the mind of a man who rapes. I mean, what in the actual fuck? The concept of rape is just insane.
Potentially/intentionally destroying another human, for an orgasm? Power? Hate? 

I spend so much time trying to be safe, moderate how I dress, where I go at what times. My life and ability to live it are extremely hindered at this point. 

I like to cook, play guitar, video games, cross stitch/crafty stuff- all things to do safely indoors. I can‚Äôt think of an outdoor activity I could do and not be panicking someone was gonna drag me into the bushes.

I‚Äôm kinda freaking out realizing how many of my ‚Äúinterests‚Äù are just hyper vigilance and trauma responses.

sclyob,"I just found this out today. I woke up from a call from my local police station, and when they mentioned the concern was about him, I just had a gutting feeling it was because he was dead. They didn‚Äôt share all the details, but the detective said he was home and he didn‚Äôt suffer. He had an absolutely horrible home life growing up, and I was like his saving grace. I was the only one that was genuinely there for him no matter what. I gave him the benefit of the doubt far too often. He was a horrible boyfriend to me; abusive in every way and a cheater. I wanted to help him because I knew he was like this from his mom, and I thought deep down he really did care and did love me. Of course our relationship started off great, and the next moment it wasn‚Äôt, and I just wanted to save him. But the truth is you can‚Äôt save someone who doesn‚Äôt want to be saved. I was the only thing keeping him alive and it wasn‚Äôt enough. He refused any sort of actual help. He was content in his misery because he knew his life would end this way.. If I was never in his life I imagine it would‚Äôve happened a lot sooner. It‚Äôs a heavy weight to bear, knowing you are what is keeping someone alive. I just didn‚Äôt know it until now. All I ever wanted was to help him, but he just took his years of pent up anger against his mom, out on me. He pushed me away when I was the only one who wanted him to thrive. He never wanted to be saved.. Maybe he pushed me away so he could do this. Maybe he didn‚Äôt want a reason to keep living‚Ä¶.

s39f4f,"‚ÄúDear Prudence,

I got married just before Christmas and am hoping to be divorced or annulled by the end of January. Obviously, that wasn‚Äôt the plan originally, but ‚Ä¶

I never cared about getting married, but I wasn‚Äôt opposed to it. So when my boyfriend proposed in 2020, we decided to go for it. We each took on about half the responsibility for organizing the wedding, but I think I was pretty reasonable about compromise when he really wanted something. My only hard-and-fast rule was that he would not rub cake in my face at the reception.

Being a reasonable man who knows me well, he didn‚Äôt. Instead, he grabbed me by the back of the head and shoved my head down into it. It was planned since the cake was DESTROYED, and he had a bunch of cupcakes as backup.

I left. Next day I told him we were done. I am standing by that. The thing is that over the holidays EVERYONE has gotten together to tell me I should give him a second chance. That I am overreacting because of my issues (I am VERY claustrophobic after a car accident years ago, and I absolutely panicked at being shoved into a cake and held there). That I love him (even though right now I don‚Äôt feel that at all), he loves me, and that means not giving up at the first hurdle. I don‚Äôt want to, but everyone is so united and confident in their assurance I am making a terrible mistake that I wonder if they are right.

Dear Till February,

Everyone‚Äôs sure you‚Äôre making a mistake, but they‚Äôre not the ones who have to wake up every day with a man whose behavior massively turns them off. You are. So you only have to listen to yourself. I think what he did was a red flag about not respecting you and your wishes‚Äîto say nothing of the physical aggression‚Äîbut even if it wasn‚Äôt, the fact that you really didn‚Äôt like it is enough. Make a mental note about which of your loved ones don‚Äôt seem to value your happiness, and continue with your divorce.‚Äù",I would be divorcing my husband too if he tried this cake crap on me!,2.0,2.0

It doesn't matter if walmart provides ""better"" wages or ""better"" covid leave policies THAN another place! 

Walmart has made record profits on the backs of you and me, the working class.

The wages they pay are CHUMP CHANGE, but we are made to think it's better than nothing.

Walmart CEOs salary is $22 million. That's $10,400 PER HOUR. Forget stock options, bonuses, and any other compensation options.

The Walton family is worth 238 BILLION dollars.

They earn $26,000/MINUTE from their walmart dividends. That's $1.5 million/HOUR, from owning us walmart employees.

[MATH: marketwatch cites 3B dividends in 2018, others cite 3.2B (above). Let's assume the conservative 3B. Full time working year is 2080 hours. Even 3B/2080hrs is 1.44M/hr in dividends! If the waltons had to ""work"" a FT schedule to earn those dividends]

Defending Walmart is like thanking the prison warden for the opportunity to be in jail.

Fuck you Walmart for knowingly, willingly, and proudly paying an UNLIVABLE WAGE to the millions of workers who made you rich beyond our wildest dreams.


Edit: I quit a few weeks ago, but the truth doesn't change.üòà

Edit 2: 
Union busting fines from the government cost walmart essentially nothing. Only $50,000 per violation (NLR ACT 8A). Walmart's Anti-Unionizing agenda costs them tons of money in expenses. YET: it is still cheaper to endure these expenses and possible fines then it is to allow a union. This desperation to pay tons to prevent unions only goes to show you how much you stand to gain. Fact: Unionized workers see higher wages and better benefits.",STOP DEFENDING WALMART!,2.0,2.0
ru3n8v,"-this was written in august of 2020-

About two months ago, I started talking to this guy on Tinder who immediately made it clear that he was a dom and would like to play with me sometime. Because of the pandemic, though, I kept delaying our meeting in person. We'd send pics to each other, short video clips, and even fooled around over Facetime a couple times, but every time we made plans they'd always fall through. Then he'd ghost me for a couple days or so until hitting me up again and fooling around more.

Well, finally this morning we got together. I woke up at 7am to a text saying ""Wake up NOW, let's go. Looking for head ASAP."" I'd never gone over to a stranger's place just for the intention of sex and nothing else, but I'd be lying if I said it didn't completely turn me on. He ordered me a car and 20 minutes later I was on his doorstep.

He led me upstairs to his apartment in almost complete silence, except for telling me where to go. We went into his bedroom and he closed the door behind him, immediately ordering me to show him my tits. I said, ""yes, sir,"" and obeyed. He told me to get on my knees and take off his pants and start playing with his dick. With both hands pumping him, and my eyes looking straight into his, I could feel him quickly getting harder and harder. I waited until he gave me permission before I finally got my mouth around him, and that's when I realized how fucking big his cock was. Not just long, but thick, too. It felt like a challenge, which made me determined to be the best little cockpig he's ever had.

He fucked my face like that, getting deeper and deeper down my throat. Over the months we chatted before meeting, I had sent lots of videos of me deepthroating one of my dildos in order to practice for him, and now that his cock was finally in my mouth he couldn't stop commenting on how proud he was that I was able to get him so far into my throat, and that I could withstand being fucked like that for so long. I was so messy - spit and slobber all over my face and chest, and he'd reach down and put it all in my hair and smear my makeup with it.

He sat on the edge of the bed and pulled me over his knees, where he spanked me and ordered me to tell him ""thank you"" after every smack. His fingers reached down to play with my pussy, and he was impressed that I was so wet just from getting my face fucked and being spanked.

He told me to turn around and sit on his cock, and I obeyed. Finally feeling his giant cock inside me after all this time was amazing and I almost came after only a couple minutes of riding him. He threw me off of his lap and ordered me to gag on his cock some more, and as my spit spilled all over his cock and balls, he had me lick it all up and spit it back on his cock again.

Then he turned me around again and pulled me onto his cock, and this time as I rode him he put a finger in my ass. I LOVE having my ass played with while I have a dick in my pussy, so it was this point when I started getting desperate and begging him to fuck me. But first, he made me earn it by impaling my throat once again.

Finally he told me to get on the bed - face down, ass up. He slammed into me and I was immediately in heaven. Feeling this huge cock that I've been dreaming about for months balls-deep inside of me was too much, and I came all over him. My pussy was so wet that he slipped out of me, so he started pushing his shaft over the rim of my asshole and we both gasped. He pushed the tip of his rock hard dick into my ass, pushed in a little further, then pulled out and slammed into my dripping wet pussy again. He told me he'd have my ass next time, and pulled my hair while going so deep and hard I could feel his balls slapping against my clit which brought me very close to cumming again.

I asked him where he wanted to cum, and he said my mouth. When it was time, he pulled out of me and ordered me on my knees again, and fucked my face until he came down my throat.
""Start getting dressed, slut,"" he said, and called me a car back home. I put my spit-covered, knotted hair into a bun and quickly threw on my clothes. He led me back to the hallway of his building and shut the door behind me without a word. I got into the car and rode home, smelling like sweat and sex, my throat sore and pussy so wet it ruined my panties.",finally getting treated like the slut i am (f26),1.0,2.0

Hmmm I‚Äôm not sure what just happened. I may have lost an FWB. Oh well. 

My FWB‚Äôs lab class ended early today, so he grabbed an Uber and came to my place from campus for a quick BJ before his next class. I promised him I would yesterday, so here we are. I happily devoured his meat until he finished. 

Usually I swallow immediately. But today, I kept it in my mouth. I wanted it all in my mouth when he french kissed me, which he usually likes to do after he gets a BJ. And when he stuck his tongue in my mouth, he immediately pulled back and started spitting. He might have said some obscene words. And he ran out.

I‚Äôm not really sure what happened exactly. But from his reaction, I am guessing he 1) has never tasted his own semen and/or 2) does not enjoy the taste of himself.

I guess I shouldn‚Äôt have assumed he was ok with tasting his own spunk. I honestly thought all guys are ok with their own. Well, lesson learned. 

TL;DR: I incorrectly assumed guys are comfortable with their own semen, and snowballed my FWB, causing him to have a violent reaction and to leave in fury. I may have lost an FWB.

Edit: He has since texted me (after class) to apologize for his rather unusual reaction. I have apologized for my part in it, which was assuming he was fine with his own semen (since he had frenched me many times before after finishing in my mouth). We will be giving each other ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Äù presents next time we meet up. :) I did not lose an FWB.

More edits: Ladies and gents, I am incredibly grateful for your thoughts on this. I am learning a lot. However, please stop the name-calling through the 500+ chat messages that I will probably never read. Yes I am a whore/slut/degenerate/etc. I agree. I own it. My FWB calls me all those things anyway when we do it. So please, cool it with the private messages. Thanks. XOXO",TIFU I incorrectly assumed guys are comfortable with their own ejaculate.,2.0,2.0

rw2nzf,"Long anticipating having a long weekend off and to myself its finally here. I can be done working and getting dirty for a few days and go have fun dressing girly and walking around with tons of other slutty dressed girls in Vegas cause thats normal there.¬†


Having an extremely hard time deciding if I should make the 16 hit drive so I can bring all of my outfits cause I never know what to wear or if I'm better off taking the 2 hour flight.¬†


Of course I've been planning this weekend for quite some time now and have talked to numerous men interested in meeting to take me out as a girl and treat me like a princess. Even tho I tell most them my outfits will say otherwise.¬†


I've talked to enough men and I figure I should drive just in case someone actually gets demanding and tells me something particular to wear for them. I don't want to not be prepared.¬†


So since I'm driving I can secure my breast plate breast forms that claim to be able to be worn for up to a week. Ill put that to the test with a long weekend! So i can get all dressed up and not bring ANY male clothes with me even for the drive!¬†


So there I am day off getting ready, dressed in something confidante but still slutty for the long drive unsure how far ill drive tonight ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è got myself advertised trying to find men in Vegas still and surrounding areas waiting fur responses always. I make sure to lock my tiny cage on and put my biggest plug in because I want to make sure this trip is all about Heather!! All of my skirts, lingerie, crop tops, high heels, some cocktail dresses, a few swimming suits, all of my dildos and a couple handfuls of my favorite panties and I'm off!


Shortly after hitting the road I no longer have service so I'm just driving along grinding my ass on my giant cock of in my ass and trying not to continuously feel myself up cause the weight of these tits on my chest just get me so excited. A couple hours of soaking my panties and grinding in my seat and I feel like I need to get out and stretch my legs but where cause I'm in high heels and a total slut. So I find a rest stop that looks not too busy and go nervously into the women's bathroom to sit down and relieve myself. While I'm sitting there I pull my phone out to check and see if i guy any new hits even tho I'm not even half way yet. I just get so excited hearing from men that want to use me i had to check.¬†


Sure enough a couple messages from numerous men. A couple that really got my attention and actually sounds like promising guys to meet. So I message a few back and send a couple pictures to try and make sure i have someone to meet tonight when I get to town. One of them is right on top of it and responds instantly to me and we start taking about how ill be in Vegas tonight. He is telling me he is already there and where he is staying asking me about my plans when I get there. So it's starting to sound like I might have a date for my first night when I get there!!


This goes on for most of the rest of the drive. Texting back and forth and even made a call or two to talk to this man that told me to refer to him as my owner! Gosh he is getting my panties so freaking wet on this drive I'm going insane. Starting to lose myself with how wet my panties are even and I stay telling him anything and everything he asks about. He then tells me if I'm so horny I better find a truck stop and suck someone off and send him proof of a cock in my mouth if I want to be his slave tonight when I get to town. So I get on grindr and start looking. Find a man about an hour away. But my new owner told me he needs to talk to the man that's going to fuck my face cause he doesn't trust me to take my own pictures he wants them directly from a man not a bitch. So I exchanged their numbers to each other and all I get for info is an address....¬†


About an hour later and I'm pulling up to the address I was told to stop at. And the only instruction I got were blindfold myself and cuff my hands behind my back, get out of my car in the dark empty parking lot. So there i an standing there still outside my car when I hear some commotion and then I hear a door shut. Then another door shut and a couple pairs of footsteps walking up to me. I start to try and scramble back for my car for but can't see and my hands are behind my back... I feel hands on my shoulders pushing me down so I kneel down and get a cock rammed down my throat when suddenly another man lifts up my ass of the ground lifts my skirt up pulls my panties to the side and jumps in. Both ruggedly fucking me senseless, spit roasting me and gagging me with their cocks. They both ram deep down inside me and flood me with cum I swear I can't take anymore when they both pull out suddenly and I collapse on the ground where they just leave me.i barely hear their doors shut and then drive off as I'm trying ty get myself collected. When my phone starts ringing inside my car. Im still blindfolded and handcuffed, so I frantically try to get my hands on front of me again and pull my blindfold off and make it back into my car. Heart racing faster than I've ever thought possible. I answer my phone, it's my new master in told upon answering.¬†


""Hello sissy bitch Heather. I'm so glad you decided it best to be owned by a real man. Now I expect to see you for dinner in 4 hours little lady. I hope you don't plan to keep me waiting like when I was calling.""


""No sir! Sorry sir I wa.

""You were just what slut? Getting stuffed with cock on both ends? Yes I know, remember? ""


My phone dings a few times and I look at it to see pictures of me getting stuffed from both ends with time and location on them.


""Omg yes sir! I remember sir""

""Good bitch, now like I said i expect to see you in 4 hours slut. And you better be cleaned up i don't need no second hand cum rag.""¬†


""But sir I'm more than 4 hours still from Vegas sir""


""Not my problem bitch. I have an expensive dinner date planned and if you make me late you're paying for it one way or another! ""


Skip to 5 hours later when i pull up to the hotel room and text him to notify sir that I've finally arrived

""Sir sorry I'm late but I'm here finally. Going to go clean up then come find you sir""


""Bummer slut. Looks like 2 hours of my time bitch. This table was 250 an hour so now you owe me 500$. So I expect to see you soon""


I get cleaned up and find a while new slutty oitfit and head down to the casino he told me to come meet him at. He was playing some high stakes games and wants me to join him since I'm already in debt to him.¬†


I get there and master tells me first thing that we need to settle my debt before I get to enjoy anything. ""Since I'm in a gambling mood already I think we are going to play some double or nothing pool or maybe darts, your choice Heather. So what'll it be slut?¬†


""Yes sir double or nothing!? Ok ill take pool i guess sir""¬†


""Alright slut shake my hand then so its a bet for double or nothing"" extends hand to reach masters. Aggressively he grabs my hand and says ""God now that we are going to shake on it. It'll be first one to win 5 games and its over. But i need money from you to start sissy. So how much are you willing to gamble sissy? I already have 500 on the table but you can do whatever you want""


So I pull out a hundred dollar bill and put it down thinking this won't be too bad i can get up to 500 from 100 if i do well.


So we get started and my first game in on fire like I always am when I haven't played in a while. I got to break and ran like 5 balls in before giving him a shot. He got 2 and it was my turn again sink my other 2, call the 8 and make it! Woo one down! Doubled my money! Now only 4 more to go! If I win them..


Starting in on the second game master informs me that I have 200 in my pot now so if i win again ill be up to 400 already! Heck yea so close to being outta debt already! I might even walk away with some money in my pocket im thinking! 'Crack' as I go to break the second rack I get a hard slap to my bare ass hanging outta my skirt and I completely fuck up the break. Master asks if i wanna play that game out or just let him have the win and start the 3rd game. I snickered ""no ill take my chances!"" As he smiles back at me ""ok bitch"" and cleans the rest of rhe table off really quick. ""Rack em, bitch!! And now you owe me 1k not 500. So you better step it up slut""


Starts the 3rd game with him breaking, and he runs it to the 8 ball before i even get to shoot. So now my heart is racing wanting to try and win this game! Trying to collect myself i pick my shot and I'm lining up, pulling back to shoot when someone sticks the butt of their pool stick up under my skirt right between my checks and I miss and scratch. Shit!!! As master pulls the cue outta the table and laughs at me. ""You're going to owe me so much you won't even know what to do faggot! That's 2 to 1. You owe me 2k and have 200 credit. Not looking so good for you slut""


Starting in the 4th game and my heart is still racing and I can't get myself contained thinking about what I'm going to do if I keep losing since I'm already at 2k now not 500.... ""Crack "" as he breaks the rack on the 4th game and looks at me ""you ready to be my bitch faggot?"" As we watch the 8 ball fall in of the break. ""Ha looks like you owe me 4 grand already slut. What the fuck are you gonna do!? 3 loses put you 4k in the hole. Next game will be 8. And when I get my 5th game 16k how are you going to pay me slut?""


""Master please that's not fair! ""


""Shouldn't have stood me up last night bitch. Rack em up again""


Now I'm worried and trying to do math to figure out if I can even make it out if I win... he breaks and its not a great break so I get a chance here. I do my best to run the table get 4 in before I miss. Master not liking please as I left him in a bad spot and can't make any good shots. My turn again. Alright let's do this i to myself as I run the rest of my before in and go to shoot my 8 ball shot ""smack "" echos through the room as master hit my with the beach if his pool cute. Causing me to miss my 8 and scratch... he stroud behind me and pressed his crotch into my red ass still bent over the table whimpering about my ass. He thrusts himself into my ass and I can feel his cock through his pants as he takes the cue in both hand and puts it in front of me and brings it back against my throat bringing my face back above my ass as he looks at me and laughs ""just chdckinf out my soon to be property faggot. You ready to give up yet? Thats 8 grand you owe me bitch you can just give up now or we can make this list game a little more interesting? ""¬†


""Interesting how sir? If I give up more been i go get money from my hotel and just pay you and be done sir?""¬†


""Yes but giving up you then are going to have to spend tonight with me if you're not going to finish our game slut. And get my money first""¬†


""Yes sir! I'll go and get it now and come right back sir!""¬†


Ok slut, as he hands me a glass, cheers to a good game, I love seeing that ass bent over this table. Now you have 15 minutes to get back here with my money or else fine doubles. Is that going to be a problem?¬†


'No sir, cheers and takes my drink. Ill be quick i promise!""¬†


Back at my hotel, already 8 minutes have gone by and I'm just now getting to my floor.... rushing now, I run past a couple hunks on my floor thinking nothing of it. Rush into my room frantically trying to pack my bags and grab all my stuff when my phone goes off. "" 10 minutes how're you feeling slut? Feeling like property yet?"" I try to comprehend but I just can't as I start feeling dizzy and see those 2 hunks walk into my room. As I fade out completely.¬†


I wake up who knows how much later who knows where. In a small room or something. I try moving but it seems like im securely tied. Standing up but more like dangling than actually standing. And I can't move anything. As I hear master in my ears. ""You never got back to me slut. You starting to feel like property yet? """,Roadtrip to meet my daddy.. (fantasy üôÅ) for now,1.0,2.0

s5dupp,"The Tourney at the Rock ended with a splendid affair. In the ancient sept of the Casterly‚Äôs, high above the Rock overlooking the Sunset Sea, amidst the throng of glittering nobility, Cynda Lannister and Erik Harlaw were wed, officiated by the High Septon itself.

The crowd had been completely unawares, and when the bride had stepped out, beautiful and radiant in a Lannister cloak, eyes went wide and whispers sang.

The two were happy beyond belief, particularly the bride, who seemed close to tears of joy at every turn. At last, the Lannister cloak was removed and a new one, featuring a silver Lion holding a scythe on a black field, was draped over her shoulders. A cheer went up, and a new alliance was made.

Gerion wanted to be happy, wanted to celebrate with his sister. This had always been something he‚Äôd felt he owed Cynda, and something they could share. But the king‚Äôs collapse had changed all of that.

There was work to be done.

As soon as the ceremony concluded, Gerion rushed to his solar. He wrote a letter to the Lords Paramount not in attendance, the Hand, and Prince Edric. He summoned Lord Vardis, and separately, the Lords and Ladies Lannister of Lannisport, Brax and Banefort, his westermen, to warn them of the storm coming.

He also, almost as an afterthought, wrote a letter to his kin in Rosby.

s5lkq7,"I (27m) proposed to my girlfriend Ellie (28f) and she said yes. We've dated for 6 years, lived together for 3, raised two cats together and talked about marriage and having children for a long time.

Title clarification: my fianc√©e is bisexual. Before we started dating, we were friends since freshman year of college. When I met her, she identified as a lesbian, which wasn't a problem for me, I even met a couple of her ex-girlfriends and supported her through her breakups. Later she realized that she was bisexual and again I supported her, then we started dating and I've never been happier.

From the start of our relationship, I made it clear to her that her sexuality wasn't an issue for me and that i accepted her for who she is. However, she's not ""openly"" bisexual, as she doesn't feel that her sexuality is anyone else's business. For that reason, I never felt the need to tell my mom about her sexuality, as I never considered it a problem or a topic of conversation, just a fact.

When I went home for dinner, I told my mom about the engagement. She was very happy, since I'm an only child and she sees Ellie as the daughter she never had. A couple of my friends who know about Ellie's sexuality went over to the house and we had a few drinks. Drunk, one of my friends commented *""How does it feel to marry someone who slept with more girls than you?""* in front of my mom.

After my friends left, my mom asked me for an explanation and I revealed my fiancee's sexuality to her. A little confused, she said *""Well, now that she's with you she's not like that anymore, right?""* and I denied it. *""No, she's still bisexual,""* to which my mom got a little mad. *""How can you marry a lesbian?""* she asked me. I explained to her that bisexual is not the same thing, but according to her, *""If she has been with women she is a lesbian.""*. I decided not to argue with her and went back to my house.

The next day, Ellie showed me a voice message she received from my mom telling her horrible things and refusing to have a daughter-in-law who uses her son as a ""screen"" to hide that she's a carpet muncher. I saw red and called my mom. Instead of apologizing, she was offended that I wasn't on her side and outed my fianc√©e in front of our entire family. Now some religious relatives are opposed to coming to our wedding, even though my cousins and a couple of uncles and aunts are on our side.

This has been very stressful and hurtful for my fianc√©e since her sexuality was always a sensitive issue for her (her mom still doesn't accept it and kicked her out for it) and all this hate towards her makes me fear that she might decide to call off the wedding.

My mom is not generally homophobic, so this new attitude of hers surprises me and makes me think that if I'd told her before, maybe she wouldn't have reacted this way. So AITA?",AITA for not telling my mom about my fiancee's sexuality?,2.0,2.0

s0mc0a,"Header: ""I'm the founder of Strong Towns, a national nonpartisan nonprofit trying to save cities from financial ruin.""

My name is Chuck Marohn, and I am part of (founder of, but really, it‚Äôs grown way beyond me and so I‚Äôm part of) the Strong Towns movement, an effort on the part of thousands of individuals to make their communities financially resilient and prosperous. I‚Äôm a husband, a father, a civil engineer and planner, and the author of two books about why North American cities are going bankrupt and what to do about it.

Strong Towns: The Bottom-Up Revolution to Rebuild American Prosperity (https://www.strongtowns.org/strong-towns-book)
Confessions of a Recovering Engineer: Transportation for a Strong Town (http://confessions.engineer)

How do I know that cities and towns like yours are going broke? I got started down the Strong Towns path after I helped move one city towards financial ruin back in the 1990‚Äôs, just by doing my job. (https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2019/7/1/my-journey-from-free-market-ideologue-to-strong-towns-advocate) As a young engineer, I worked with a city that couldn‚Äôt afford $300,000 to replace 300 feet of pipe. To get the job done, I secured millions of dollars in grants and loans to fund building an additional 2.5 miles of pipe, among other expansion projects.

I fixed the immediate problem, but made the long-term situation far worse. Where was this city, which couldn‚Äôt afford to maintain a few hundred feet of pipe, going to get the funds to fix or replace a few miles of pipe when the time came? They weren‚Äôt.

Sadly, this is how communities across the United States and Canada have worked for decades. Thanks to a bunch of perverse incentives, we‚Äôve prioritized growth over maintenance, efficiency over resilience, and instant, financially risky development over incremental, financially productive projects.

How do I know you can make your place financially stronger, so that the people who live there can live good lives? The blueprint is in how cities were built for millennia, before World War II, and in the actions of people who are working on a local level to address the needs of their communities right now. We‚Äôve taken these lessons and incorporated them into a few principles that make up the ‚ÄúStrong Towns Approach.‚Äù (https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2015/11/11/the-strong-towns-approach)

We can end what Strong Towns advocates call the ‚ÄúGrowth Ponzi Scheme.‚Äù (https://www.strongtowns.org/the-growth-ponzi-scheme) We can build places where people can live good, prosperous lives. Ask me anything, especially ‚Äúhow?‚Äù

---

Thank you, everyone. This has been fantastic. I think I've spent eight hours here over the past two days and I feel like I could easily do eight more. Wow! You all have been very generous and asked some great questions. Strong Towns is an ongoing conversation. We're working to address a complex set of challenges. I welcome you to plug in, regardless of your starting point.

Oh, and my colleagues asked me to let you know that you can support our nonprofit and the Strong Towns movement by becoming a member and making a donation at https://www.strongtowns.org/membership

Keep doing what you can to build a strong town!

sckjvd,"OK, I didn‚Äôt really know, but the red flags at her wedding were waving loudly!

Before I start, I must mention I'm also an older Redditor, so this is all seen thru the lens of someone born before 1965. 

1. Didn‚Äôt see engagement press ceremony. But pictures released afterward of her looked weird to me. Why was her hair such a mess? Why didn‚Äôt she wear stockings? Why was she grinning maniacally and sticking her butt and boobs out? 

My daughter said I‚Äôm old, and those are things old people would comment on. Hmm, maybe she‚Äôs right and this young woman is excited and boho and doesn‚Äôt do hair or stockings or tailored clothes. 

But wait‚Ä¶

2. She‚Äôs then wearing an ungodly expensive sheer dress for her engagement pictures, and has sultry, pouty faces. She‚Äôs posing, like a model? Seems inappropriate. They must be wrong about the cost of the dress, and surely it‚Äôs not that sheer on top, it‚Äôs just lighting. 

3. Oh, the dress is that expensive. $50k? Wow, I never heard of her, she must be really rich to afford something like that. ‚ÄúSuits‚Äù or whatever that cable show is called must be really popular! She must get paid a ton, because surely she wouldn‚Äôt ask Charles to pay for it. It‚Äôs odd a show about lawyers and her role as a paralegal is so popular, I‚Äôm a lawyer and we‚Äôre really boring. And paralegals don‚Äôt swan around like she does‚Ä¶at least not any I‚Äôve ever seen. Oh well‚Ä¶daughter and I both shrug‚Ä¶I guess she‚Äôs not a young woman wearing her hair casually and no stockings and weird shoes. She‚Äôs almost 40, but maybe she was just overwhelmed‚Ä¶

4. Didn‚Äôt even remember the wedding was on. Turned it on at the point when Jessica Mulroney arrived with the flower girls. And HOLY CRAP. She waited at the bottom of the stairs to be the last one up‚Ä¶everyone else is corralling  kids, but she hangs back. Then she goes up the stairs swinging her hips so much‚Ä¶at first I thought she had a walking problem. And then she holds out her arms to make her body look smaller, maybe? What kind of friend is this, who tries to steal all this attention from the bride? Wow, Megan has really crappy friends. 

5. Well, then Meghan arrives and I move past her hideous weird scene stealing narc friend and await her dress. I just assumed it wouldn‚Äôt be white and virginal and dramatic and grandiose bcs she‚Äôs 37 and has been married before! Also, she‚Äôs a feminist and I didn‚Äôt think she would pick a ‚Äúvirginal princess‚Äù dress. I truly thought it would be something like Camilla wore at her wedding. 

My daughter says anyone can wear white nowadays no matter the wedding.  And yeah, sure. But a long veil covering her face? A long train? A blinding white dress? And she‚Äôs 37! Tacky boho tendrils sticking out? 

6. So wow. I didn‚Äôt really know about her father, I just assumed someone would be walking her down the aisle. Shocking to see her ‚Äúfloat‚Äù alone down the aisle. Just so attention getting. 

7. She gets up to PH, and looks down all shyly and virginal when she sees him. OK - she‚Äôs 37! She‚Äôs been married before! I thought she was a modern feminist, not some doe eyed ingenue. Either she‚Äôs insane and crazy, or I‚Äôm not seeing things correctly. 

8. The sermon. Again - I guess I didn‚Äôt really know she was mixed race. And I assumed it would be a 50/50 wedding‚Ä¶50% contribution from both sides ‚Ä¶ American and British. Like when my Catholic cousin married a Baptist, both pastors contributed. Both sides were represented. But this seemed ALL Meghan‚Äôs side and style. I hate to use this word, but it just seemed so ‚Äúwoke.‚Äù It was out of place‚Ä¶just felt fake. The music was great tho. Later, they said she picked the minister to ‚Äòshake things up.‚Äô He was great, and I liked listening to him. But why is she trying to shake up a 1000 year old monarchy she agreed to marry into. So obnoxious. Why is she shoving her style and ideas into their faces? 

Well‚Ä¶I thought, maybe she‚Äôs just really religious and he is her pastor and he was thrilled to preach for her. That‚Äôs nice of him! Except of course we later learned she didn‚Äôt know him. 

9. And last. During the service, they kept panning to really really famous people in the congregation. People even someone my age knows. It started to seem really odd to me she invited all these Uber famous besties of hers, but I still had never heard of her? I would have thought that if she ran around in such VIP circles, I would have heard her name before. Of course, now we know she just invited them, and not her family. 

I know this is long, and thanks for reading, if you did. It just strikes me that it was all there from the beginning, just none of us believed our own eyes. This has all been percolating in my mind for awhile. I will never forgot how crazy that wedding was.","The Wedding, or when I knew",2.0,2.0

sahoy3,"and they either dismiss it/shrug or laugh? I actually had one person that listened to some of the more credible podcasts and found it interesting/asked questions but eventually stopped caring too much. I showed a coworker Lue Elizondo's admission on CNN that ""we may not be alone"" and maybe that was too direct for them because they just laughed and said the guy was obviously crazy. Is it a coping mechanism? It is just that some need hard evidence? Maybe it's too much for some to conceptualize so they kinda just shut down? I've heard others say when stuff isn't going well in people's personal lives, they tend to fixate on the metaphysical/unknown phenomena. Maybe that's the case for some but, I feel that there really is a genuine curiosity about this from people here, myself included-- or at least an open mind. 

Obviously nobody has concrete proof of all of this but instead, there are many eye witness reports, photo/video evidence and credible people coming from academia/the government endorse the phenomena. I just hope in a few+ years time more people stop scoffing at this and actually try to learn about the world around them.

""The events will include members gathering on the House floor at noon for a prayer, a pledge and a moment of silence for those who died after a group of former President Donald Trump's supporters stormed the building in an ill-fated attempt to stop Congress from certifying President Joe Biden's 2020 election win.

The live-streamed program will then move to the Capitol complex's Canon Caucus Room, where historians Doris Kearns Goodwin and Jon Meacham will engage in a discussion on establishing and preserving ""the narrative of January 6th,"" moderated by Librarian of Congress Dr. Carla Hayden. Representative Jason Crow (D-Colo.) will host an opportunity for members to ""share their reflections of the day"" in the same room. The day of remembrance will conclude with a prayer vigil held on the Capitol steps.""

How do you feel about these events planned?

What do you think should happen?

Would it feel odd to let the date go by without acknowledging the Capitol riot a year ago?

The suspect was arrested for obstructing a police officer after handing a legal advice card to a 15 year old being stopped and searched in 2013.

At the station she refused to give her name and the custody sergeant instructed officers to strip search her by cutting her clothes off to demonstrate that ‚Äúresistance is futile‚Äù and declared ‚Äútreat her like a terrorist, I don‚Äôt care.‚Äù

CCTV then captured the following exchange after the search:

scwcnv,"So used to work in bars & clubs & I still keep in touch w some girls from time to time on sm or text.. nothing too crazy.  Here and there it turns into sexting/pics.  

One girl in particular, however, gets off to the fact that im married now. She knows my wife, as they used to hang out back in the partying days, & she cums from the mean & deviant fantasies she conjures up in her naughty warped mind. Kind of beyond the usual cheating type texts.. 

For example, she‚Äôll say things like ‚ÄúI want to ride your face in your marital bed (yes she says marital bed lol) and squirt all over your face on her pillow.‚Äù Or ‚ÄúI want you to stick your ring finger up my ass & fuck me with it till im ready to cum, then pull it out so I can squirt all over it.‚Äù

Sometimes she‚Äôll be outright evil, saying things like ‚ÄúI want us to get caught on purpose when you know she‚Äôll be coming home, then u handcuff her to the bedpost & force her to watch u cum inside me.. then we make her eat it out.‚Äù  And believe me, they get worse. 

I entertain them, as they are simply fantasies & words.. & as a student of sociology and psychology, they are honestly incredibly interesting to me. I would not actually cheat on my wife w the girl.  But the thing is.. they always make me cum so hard too. Im not sure why the thought of this girl cumming all over my wife‚Äôs pillow would be a turn on to me, but.. it is ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è and so are all the other deviant homewrecking scenarios her mind creates.

EDIT #2: thanks to all who genuinely helped. I didn‚Äôt expect a very warm reception to this post as I‚Äôm very aware that I should know more about taxes for my age and that it‚Äôs a bit pathetic to still have my family help me with it. But asking for help is kind of what this subreddit is for, right? Also, I understand shaming me for my ignorance, but I can‚Äôt help but feel that the response would be a bit warmer if I was asking about how to report my serving tips. Thanks again to all who helped, especially those without judgment. 


I have recently started exchanging sexual photos and videos of myself for money with one person over an anonymous messaging service. Only one person, no one else. My face is never in the frame and I have no other online presence pertaining to this matter and this person has no access to my real name, phone number, or personal email. He pays me over pay pal which I signed up for with a fake name and email, but the PayPal account is linked to my bank account. 

I know you have to make a minimum $400 to be taxed, and I‚Äôm more then halfway there after just a week and a half. 

The thing is, I really want to keep this private. My parents have access to my tax information still, and they absolutely cannot know about any of this.

The PayPal account is a personal account, not a business account, however my ‚Äúclient‚Äù sends the money as ‚Äúgoods and services‚Äù instead of a gift. 

I really don‚Äôt want there to be any trace of myself to this for personal reasons. I was thinking of asking him to send the money as a gift instead and to subtract the 10% fee from it. If the money coming into my account from PayPal was originally sent as a gift, would this seem sinister and likely flagged?

It‚Äôs not that much money compared to how much I used to make in tips as a server, and I‚Äôm pretty sure I that never reported those and never got any flack for that.

I would love some advice for how to best approach this in the way that best preserves my privacy and anonymity in this. Ideally, I would appreciate ways to not report this. It hardly feels like income because of the casual nature of our interactions. However, obviously the worst case scenario would be getting charged with tax fraud, and the second worst case scenario would be my family finding out. Please give me advice for how I can best manage this financially. Thank you!",Taxes and light sex work: help?,2.0,2.0

sdfbry,"""All"" wealth?  No, but ""most""? Yes.

In a capitalist system there are two classes who combine efforts to produce: the capitalist class who directs, and the working class who carries out the directions.  Together they produce and prosper.

The problem with the rules of the capitalist system is that the capitalist decides how large a piece of the profit pie he will take.  And before I go any farther I want to be clear that the ""movers and shakers"" in today's capitalism in the most advanced countries are the so-called multi-national corporate capitalists.  Sole proprietorships and small partnerships don't create policy or influence government with their money.  So my remarks are limited to the billionaire movers and shakers of the large corporations.

The usual practices involved in creating the multi-national corporations go something like an entrepreneur invests some of his money in creating the original business, possibly with the participation of others.  Later, the corporation borrows funds from a bank to expand further and develop the business.  Profitable business pays for business expenses plus officer and worker pay.

As the business becomes profitable, the startup investments are taken back by the ""owner/s"".   Bank loans are repaid out of earnings but bank loans are a constant and continuing part of business.  The business grows, increases in book value, and the top officers and the Board of Directors get richer and richer while the workers get a paycheck.  Billionaires are/were created while the real median wage of workers remains mostly flat for 40 years.

Everyone involved participated in making the business successful.  But those in control legally took a disproportionate share of the rewards while failing to fairly compensate the workers.   All participated.  The CEO did his job, the top officers did their jobs, and the workers did their jobs.  But the workers were ""left behind"" with far less income growth.  I'm not saying the gains should have been distributed equally per person.  I'm not saying it wasn't all completely legal.  I'm not saying the labor of the workers produced all the product value.  I'm saying the gains were not distributed proportionately, and the evidence for this is that the real median income of workers was mostly flat for 40 years while the income of the top wealthy 1% doubled more than once.  Productivity exploded, but the workers' income languished.

So who created the wealth of the billionaires?  Mostly the workers did.  Those billions were legally reappropriated from the workers.

The apologists for capital at this point protest that the workers ""voluntarily entered into an agreement to accept a wage"".  That's true but irrelevant to the point I made.  They protest that ""the workers could have found another job that paid better!"" but not only is that debatable and very unlikely, but it is also childish, short-sighted nonsense.

The laws of capitalism and the government that oversees the capitalist system created a ""right"" for capitalists to appropriate workers' surplus value, and then defended and protected that created ""right"".  And it has gone too far.  That wealth is mostly, logically, the workers' money.   A large portion of it should be clawed back by tax law but for the dedication of the government to capitalist wealth accumulation.  It should be used for the benefit of society and the people who live in said society.  Greed is not useful.",Are the workers the source of all wealth?,2.0,2.0

Although it is of course sad to see any of our subscribers       struggling with their health - be it mental or physical - we have been greatly encouraged to see how supportive our community has been regarding these issues, and heartened that people have found /r/soccer a safe place in which they feel able to open up regarding issues which sadly do remain stigmatised in society at large. 

Regardless of the colour of your shirt (or the flair next to your username) we are all living, breathing human beings - and we all love the beautiful game. Everyone on /r/soccer deserves to be happy and well - so be kind. It can be a tough old world out there, and that kindness can go a long way.

sbrkuf,"I belong to a dating discussion group online, one that is geared toward plus-size women. Members can share their experiences with each other, vent, seek advice. Something that comes up a lot is men immediately turning the conversation to sex. Very lewd comments about the woman's body or the guy saying he wants to do certain things to her. It's usually right after the guy says hi, or sometimes he doesn't even say hi at all -- it's just *boom* sex comment.

I'd love some perspective on *why*. I know a lot of women, regardless of body type, receive messages like this, but it seems like plus-size women do more often. The comments about her body. The assumption that she's okay with a total stranger telling her that he wants her to sit on him. The comments probably wouldn't happen face-to-face and I think most sensible people would agree that the comments are just rude, peiod.

So, why are they still said?

Please know, I'm not asking with an anti-men agenda. I honestly would like some perspective, that's all. I've tried asking the men who say things like that to me, and the reply is usually something like, ""lol I don't know."" But I think they do know -- sending those messages is a choice.

s32epj,"Is Sanitar's office a popular place for people to wallbang through the door? I just started running resort at the end of last wipe and this wipe so I am still feeling out strategies for the resort. 

Last night I finally found my OScope for my thicc case task and I get tapped through the door while im standing in the bathroom area of Sanitars office. 1 bullet of 55A1, top of head. 

I pull up the guy who killed me on Twitch and rewatch his vod. He is watching the door because he knows I am inside (him and his duo smoked 2 of my buddies minutes prior). He then takes an angle from across the hall and keeps his red dot on the door, then crouches perfectly in line with my head and 2 taps me through the door. No full auto spray, No multiple angles of shooting through the door. 2 taps, directly after crouching perfectly in line with me head. Then he packs his magazine, and does surgery on both of his arms, almost like he felt safe after.

They open the door and proceed to throw 3 or 4 more grenades into the room before my body is found and the streamer ""no wayyyyy bro i one tapped him through the door, no wayyyy"". 

Obviously I am salty as ever after getting wallbanged headshot but I have a hard time believing this guy just luckily shot 2x EXACTLY where my head was (and literally crouched to be exactly in line with ME while i was crouched) through a door that I was in for probably 5 minutes. Usually if people wallbang they dump 5-15 rounds IME. I find it insanely suspicious, but if someone really runs resort all day then they might know certain angles better than me.

Is this spot a big known area for wallbangs through the door? Is that an angle people usually hold to lock people into the bathroom area? Furthermore, what are some tips to hitting sanitars key without getting pinned or ratted on? Second raid in a row I found an OScope and died with it.

I get enough matches to have a decent date every now and again but it's not like I feel like I actually chose those matches and most of the matches I do get ill have lowered my standards so much for that I'm not even sure it's worth it.

I don't think I'm amazingly attractive but I go to the gym 6 days a week for the past four years and I'm lean enough to have visible abs and I'm attending university so I suppose my life is somewhat put together. I think it would be reasonable to have standards like not overweight, etc but apparently not with tinder/bumble. It just sucks that pretty much all matches I end up getting are with smthn like where the person is quite substantially overweight or there's some other quite blatant thing which can be seen as conventionally unattractive. In 6 months of use I've only managed to match with two people that I wanted to swipe right on before tinder crushed my standards.

And I get that women have their own problems etc but for gods sake, try and make getting hundreds of matches sound like a problem because the quality isn't good enough when I deadass have like one person on mine. Kinda soul crushing ngl.

I know women also get spammed to death etc but a lot of the time how one sided the interactions and pursuit even after matching is just kind of saddening.

Edit: just in reference to the gym, I just wanted to state that it's a passion of mine and I'm not just annoyed because I joined the gym go get girls or smthn. I was just trying to justify me believing I could pass as at least an average looking guy. I only meant to say that women have higher standards on dating apps as compared to irl or at least thats what I've experienced. It also would logcally make sense so I don't see a problem with this.

Edit again: I don't even care if my partners were to go to the gym. None of my past partners have and I haven't cared in the slightest. The people I were referencing that I matched with in the past were quite overly large and I think there is a point where I'm allowed to say it's too much.",Dating as a guy is just depressing,2.0,2.0

sg4quc,"When I met him, I was in my early twenties and he was hitting his thirties. I moved cities to be with him, knowing no one except him in that city. He lived with his parents, who did his laundry, cleaned his room and cooked him dinner every night. 

He gaslit me a lot. Everything was always my fault. He would punish me by going silent for days on end (staying at his parent's place), refusing to contact me until he saw fit. He and his mates went to strippers a lot. One time, after a private show, where the stripper/sex worker had sex with his mates, he brought home the DVD he bought off of the sex worker/stripper and suggested we have sex while watching it together. I refused. He would tell me I should get a boob job, but refused to pick me up from the surgery clinic, or care for me, when I got my ears pinned back (they stuck out and I had always been self conscious of them). He said getting my ears pinned back ""was elective surgery that I didn't need and he shouldn't have to care for me when I get a procedure I don't need"". He would tell me I should get nail manicures with fake nails and eyelash extensions. I had an eating disorder (bulimia), which he was completely aware of, and he would regularly tell me I should work out more so my body was tighter and more muscley. I was 44kg and weak from a lack of nutrition. He had a wandering eye and would constantly point out good looking females to me and ask me if I would have sex with them or consider a threesome. 

We were in a relationship for two years, then he broke up with me. Conveniently this break up was leading up to when he would be going on his first ever overseas trip with his other single male friend. While on his trip, he had sex with tourists in backpackers hotels, all while texting me saying he missed me and wanted us to get back together. When he got back from overseas, he told me about having sex with tourists, in detail - there was one in particular that he showed me photos of and asked if I would have sex with her. He was still contacting this particular tourist (who lived only a state away from us) while we were rekindling our relationship. I was in the wrong when I said I wasn't comfortable with him contacting them. He said we were only ""seeing each other"" and not in a relationship together. During this time, he was spending 5/7 days at my home with me. 

We came to a final loggerhead about a year after his overseas trip - this conversation was all through text. He had upgraded us from ""seeing each other"" to being in a relationship a few months prior. The disagreement resulted from me suggesting we should do our taxes together. His mum does his taxes so he said no; that I can do my own taxes and his mum will do his, per usual. I contested this saying it was a good next step towards his independence and to further our relationship to do our taxes together. He started getting angry and I started being fascious/giving some tongue-in-cheek about the whole situation, trying to dampen his anger about it. I asked him to call me so we could discuss it properly (he was on his lunch break) but he refused. 

In these types of situations in the past, he would either ignore me for days on end, so that I would doubt my own stance on the matter, or he would threaten to break up with me, making me backtrack my own stance because I loved him and wanted to be with him. But now I was sick of his games. 

That day, he ended up choosing the ""break up"" tactic, over text message. I wrote back: ""If you're serious about breaking up with me like this over a discussion about doing our taxes together, you won't hear from me again"". He wrote back that he was serious. So that was it. I finally stuck up for myself and I  went no contact with him and anyone affiliated with him. 

It's been over three years now.

He has been texting me every 8-months or so, saying he feels guilty about how things ended and asking to catch up. I haven't answered any of the texts. Sometimes I feel bad for not responding and think I should respond telling him to leave me alone. But if I respond, then he knows his messages came through and that I've read them. For me, going no contact means he shouldn't get that satisfaction.

sfzlnq,"So there may be some people coming along who aren't really sure what's happening. Wrote this up and posted it on OOTL as TLDR as I could - while highlighting what's actually going on.

Racist, fascist, western separatist from the Maverick Party(named Tamara Lich) in Alberta decided to grift money from a group of individuals known for being uneducated (truckers, stereotype, I know).

Another supporter and founder is Ben Dichter - an alt-right politician who is on a 'Crusade Against Islam'

The other founder is a literal Nazi named Patrick King who is a white supremacist and accelerationist.

They start this convoy bullshit as an ""anti-mandate"" protest, driving 75% of the way across Canada at $6 a gallon to own the libs. Literally driving across Canada to prove they aren't free.

Tamara started a GoFundMe, which was frozen around $4.7million - until they could provide transparency in spending. She's since started taking donations directly to her bank account. They've released (I believe) $1 million.

They claim there's over 100,000 trucks in the convoy, when it's more like 137 (I counted the entire fleet in a video posted). Most of the vehicles are pickups and SUVs. This doesn't even factor in the number of trucks on the road for normal daily traffic. Total was probably closer to 90 trucks.

They're driving to Ottawa to Parliament Hill, even though it's vacant, to protest vaccination mandates. They don't seem to realize that they can't cross the border because of the US's vaccine mandate on land-border crossing non-citizens.

The whole thing is a grift on stupid people, and they're sucking it up like piglets on a teat.

Now they're desecrating a statue of Terry Fox, the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, parking on the Cenotaph's steps and shitting in the streets. They are harassing small businesses and hotel workers, they've raided a soup kitchen and a homeless shelter, they're threatening bar owners and flying the Nazi, Gadsden and Confederate flags two days after we're honoring the memory of those in the Holocaust. Hell, there's even a lot of Trump flags. 

They are lighting off fireworks at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. They are continuously on their horns from dusk until dawn - while surrounding a local hospital and they are blocking ambulances. They are selling ""Hang Trudeau"" merch. They are flying upside-down Canadian flags on our Highway of Heroes, which our fallen servicepeople travel.

These people are white supremacist scum, and this whole event proves that systematic racism is alive and well in Canada. They claim Trudeau is hiding, but he was never going to be at Parliament Hill to begin with. He was never going to meet with them. He does not live on Parliament Hill, and Parliament is not in session.

This is the Fyre Festival of Coups. It's literally earned the names PooDaTah, FluDaTah, FluTruxKlan, Karen Konvoy, KKKonvoy, Sedan Seditionists, Trucklodytes, the Caillou Convoy and more. 

All in the name of ""ending mandates!"" which are mostly provincial, set by Provincial Health Officers following scientific data. 

I should note, many prominent figures like Joe Rogan have said it's about ""50,000 trucks"" ignoring the fact that there's a couple hundred at most.

This is likely one of the biggest grifts of our time.

I want to add that I think a lot of people genuinely had good intentions, and a lot of people were taken advantage of under the guise of ""Canadian Patriotism"". There will be people who will instantaneously drop support when they find out, and they should not be ostracized for falling victim to something like this.  


Edit: thank you all for the support with the post. The replies to this post have proven that hate is not the answer. I have to head to bed, I wish you all a great night, stay safe and healthy friends.

As far as we can tell, the first two years of her life were spent mainly in a cage, and she may have never gone to the bathroom outside until we got her two and a half years ago.  It took weeks to get her to pee outside for the first time when she came to live with us, and she is still not fully housetrained.  Medical issues have been ruled out, and she can go 8 to 10 hours without peeing when we're at work and has no problem going throughout th night, but if we're at home, she will pee if she's left alone in our kitchen/living room area.  Basically if someone goes out to get the mail or goes into the bathroom, the Pom pees.   

I  take her out every 2.5 to 3 hours when I'm home, but basically she can pee again any time after the 90 minute mark if left alone.

The last two weeks I was home non-stop, and I really worked on getting her to only go outside.  She's very food motivated, so she would get a treat the second she finishes going outside.  And outside of two or three accidents, it worked for 15 days straight.  And then my girlfriend returned from out of town, and the Pom started her old habits almost immediately.

sbn57m,"I keep seeing posts here this week about the ""fucktoy for a night"" vs ""boyfriend material"" debate, with men saying why it bothers them vs women trying to argue it's no big deal. I will end this debate now. It bothers men because it establishes manipulation and lies as the foundation of the relationship; it establishes that she fully views sex with you as entirely transactional and that she does not actually desire you. Women claim ""Oh wow, men are really upset she chose to be in a relationship with you and fuck you multiple times, what fools!"" They are ignoring the caveats. What she has established is that sex for you has absolutely nothing to do with desire for you, she doesn't actually want you, sex is bound up in the money you spend on her, you acting as her personal therapist, you being her only friend, her feelings of obligation as part of your ""relationship"". It is like a concealed form of prostitution where you offer more than just money, but are also doing emotional labor for the prostitute. See, men are not naive, we are not fools. We know that when women claim that they woild not date those men they quickly fuck, they are telling a **bold faced lie**. Men recognize their girlfriend is lying to them, does not actually ""love them"" or desire them, and in truth, would have loved to have those Chads they fucked as their boyfriends if they believed those men could actually commit. Men are not insecure, they know their girlfriend would cheat on them in an instant if the guy they claimed was ""just"" a one-night stand either offered a relationship or even just another night of sex. 

It is an insult, and it is a punishment, sex is a reward not because of the physical act that any loveless hooker could give, but because it signifies actual desire and shows that she never actually desired you. If a man has a gf that made him wait for months after sleeping with Chads in a day or a week, he would be childishly naive not to suspect her motives and what actions she may take discretely.","Men are upset about being ""boyfriend material"" because it offers the same amount of validation that seeing a prostitute does",1.0,2.0

sacucp,"(Sorry in advance for the formatting im on a phone) So I joined a game that in the post said that every book was legal. And I create a character concept which IMO is pretty powerful. I warn the dm of this and tell them what it can do at later levels. They okay it at the time and everything is good. I get a message the following day telling me ""your characters to powerful and I can't be bothered balanacing encounters around you. You can't play it any more"" I asked why they felt this way, the responded that they had ONLY NOW read my character sheet and it wasn't okay when we have a game tonight. So I explained that they probably should have read the sheet before hand and that they set an expectation that everything printed in a book was legal. They told me that ""if you don't like a dm setting boundaries the  get out. I'm saying no"" so I asked what was so over powered about the character and they blocked me. 

Tldr: dm opens the flood gates for powerful characters. Okays it before reading. Doesn't like it after reading and bans me when I call them out for being lazy

2008: Volkswagen Infinity Squeeze. Porsche has just finished an acquisition resulting in their total holdings of VW to reach 74.1% of VW's float. Lower Saxony, the German State, already previously held 20% of the float. Essentially, both parties DRS'ed their holdings of VW's float (by filing and publicly announcing their positions) and literally & collectively locked up 94.1% of the float, leaving just shy of 6% to trade with a SI of 12%. The volatility that resulted was effectively the same as if the stock had been shorted 200%, as only 6% of the float remained available to trade, and twelve is two times six.

##TL;DR: Locking Up The Float By DRS Is What Will Make The Difference Between MOASS and Just ASS, And The Closer We Get To 100% Means The Harder We Squeeze.

s10wj0,"So whenever the topic of Tyrion murdering Shae comes up, I notice a bunch of you lil boys try to play it off like she attempted to have him killed at the trial. Like her testimony was something to the effect of attempted murder.

And I'm going to explain why that's ridiculous;

First, nobody is going to kill Tyrion Lannister on the word of *Random Washerwoman #3*. The text makes very clear that the most damning testimony was Varys, with all of his notes and papers. Tyrion specifically remembers this while walking behind Varys in the torture dungeons, thinks about killing him, and lets it go.

Second, Tyrion specifically tells Pod to disavow him publicly, exactly what Shae did, because it would have put his life in danger to do otherwise. And if a squire from a noble family was in danger, what does that say about Shae?

It wasn't because she lied about him killing Joffrey, it was because she told everyone the truth about that 'giant of Lannister' thing she'd say to him in bed. He killed her because she embarrassed him. He basically says that right before he starts choking her.

She asked him to take her with him, which is ironic because his big anxiety with her was always this knowledge that she only wanted him for his wealth, and now she's basically offering to go with him, just him, even now that he's disconnected from all his family's money. He *could* have forgiven her, taken her with him, and lived in Illyrio's manse a lot happier than he was getting drunk and vomiting all over himself every night because of all the guilt and betrayal he was left with.

People will go to absurd lengths to justify Tyrion's shittiness, or even recontextualize it as heroism, when the books are very clearly building him up as at least a semi-villain.

Like, I see people try to argue that the wolves didn't trust him because of things that were removed from the books. And I mean...really? *Really??* He's obviously not going to burn Winterfell, but how much of a hackneyed writer would George R.R. Martin have to be to put foreshadowing that big in his story and then not have it come to anything?",Just to be super clear as to why Tyrion did what he did with Shae (Spoilers Extended),2.0,2.0

s5tpr7,"Another day, another Karen to make me question why I ever filled out my first application to work as a Front Desk Host 7 years ago.

&#x200B;

It's the start of my shift, and I come in with my venti iced chai that I was 5 minutes late for. My manager greets me, I put down my bag, and let out a sigh as the magnets on my name tag clack together. Officially on duty.

I step up to the desk, and get the run down from the AM shift. Really, all I am interested in is my Chai, since it sounded like a slow day.

But then, *she* gets mentioned.

""Yeah OP, I tried to run 708's card again (like I had done the night before, since she came up on our high balance report, and her CC didn't go through. Made a note in our MOD report), and nothing. Try to get in touch with her if you can, since she has a reservation to extend. Have a good night""

The AM shift departs.

With a sigh, I decide to call up to 708 ""Hi there miss, this is Op at the front desk. Would you mind coming down to speak with me about the outstanding balance on your room? the Credit card we have isn't going through""

She comes down, and her tirade starts.

Turns out, she has had a really long night, and doesn't need us bothering her all day about a couple of dollars (98.23 to be exact). She tried to swipe her card, and na-da. Tries a different card, and na-da.

I am in the middle of trying to figure out what's going on, and she calls the bank.

Turns out my AM shift ran 13 authorizations on her card for random small amounts (trying to collect any balance towards her bill). Despite all authorizations declining, the man on the phone tells her that her account got over drawn, by the exact amount my AM shift ran (minus $5, which was the last $5 she had on the planet).

She turns to me, fury in her eyes.

Her tirade evolves into a full fledge shit-storm. How dare *I* take the last amount of her money? How did *I* even get that card on file ? (She gave it to us?????) *I* am stealing from her!

I apologize, and let her know that my AM shift was just trying to collect the payment, that we used the card she gave us at check in (duh), and that we are just running our business, which she consented to pay for.

She just gurgles up more random crap, and I am being worn thin. I decide to take a second, step to the back, and tell my manager what's going on to get some back up.

It's to note, that I am the FOM. I went to our Operations Manager. We discuss how she owes us money, but also wants to extend, but her card has zip on it.

Anyone in the industry would expect an answer of: ""Well if she can't pay, she can't stay"".

Not. Today.

My Manager goes out to this guest, apparently with extreme generosity in her heart, and proceeds to make a deal with the guest:

If the guest promises that she can pay for the room later this week when she has money, and gets paid, we would comp her tonight (Sunday) in good faith.

The guest states that she NOW wants to check out on Tuesday.

My Manager gives her ANOTHER free night.

The guest agrees, and leaves smiling, flipping me the bird as she ascends the elevator.

My manager says:

""Have faith in people, OP. You have to learn that people will do the right thing in the end""

...What?...

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

UPDATE 1.19.2022:

To the shock of NO ONE, she wasn't able to pay the balance of her second night (before the two nights were comp'd). So, our broken Karen got 3 free nights.

s2f0fl,"Late night talk show host, Jimmy Kimmel's emotional tribute to Bob Saget.

Bob Saget died at the age of 65.

""Jimmy Kimmel"" = 65 (Reverse Full Reduction)

He was quoted in the news as saying that he had taped it like, ""14 Times.""

""14 Times"" = 26 (Full Reduction)
""Bob Saget"" = 26 (Full Reduction)

His tribute came 239-days after Saget's birthday. 
239 is the 52nd prime number in math.
""Jimmy Kimmel"" = 52 (Full Reduction)
""Saget"" = 52 (English Ordinal)

Bob Saget died on 1/9/2022.
1/9/2022 = 1+9+20+22 = 52

Remember, Bob Saget was the beloved dad of the series ""Full House"" and ""Fuller House.""

1/11/2022 = 1+1+1+2+0+2+2 = 9
He died on the 9th day of the year.

""Dad"" = 9 (English Ordinal)
""Dad"" = 9 (Full Reduction)

Again, this is proof that everything in entertainment is done by sick numbers rituals.

rxbh7f,"I‚Äôm a commercial marketing director for a huge ass company. I had an extremely unprofessional and aggressive email sent to me by one of our VPs, who is known for her shitass behavior, rooted in a total misunderstanding. It literally confused me because the things she was saying were totally not true, totally misconstrued, she is several degrees away from the matter at hand, and her degree of hostility, confidence, and aggression shocked me. She not only sent me one email, but in the five minutes following the initial one, during which I was writing a reply to defuse the misunderstanding, she sent three more, each time looping in various other VP‚Äôs, higher ups, and my own VP boss. There were eight people on this chain at the end. My boss told me don‚Äôt worry about it, she would handle her, she knows this woman goes flying off the rails on a regular basis. She told me not to reply or engage because it‚Äôs what the lady wants, and anything other than rolling over and showing the belly and giving a groveling apology (which isn‚Äôt happening) will inflame the situation.

This whole thing made me fucking livid, especially being trashed in a public way via an email chain with the executives I work daily who have no context that this whole thing (which is over a fucking PowerPoint slide) is total misunderstanding on her part. Luckily I have a good reputation and nothing will come of it other than my hurt feelings.

So later today, as part of this shit with this fucking ppt slide which is for a team meeting on Friday, we now have to meet to go over it. I am not overly emotional at all, especially with work, but I‚Äôm so livid over this that I‚Äôm having a hard time talking about it without crying. Even when I talked to my boss, who was totally cool, I could feel my lip quivering and was having a hard time controlling my voice from going into cry mode.

Therefore, we will be using a megathread to group the posts on the convoy to avoid this topic taking over the sub. As before, some explanations of how this will work:

* Anyone creating a post about the protest who does not have a significant history with this sub will be **banned**, no questions asked. If you do have a history with this community, the post will be removed and you will be warned.
* This community is about OTTAWA, not Covid nor the related restrictions. Remember that.
* Any links or pictures to their propaganda will be removed. Do not give them publicity.
* I will be watching the megathread. Remember that disinformation/misinformation about covid is [a violation of the site wide rule #1](https://old.reddit.com/r/ottawa/comments/retftg/why_was_this_comment_deleted_what_rules_were/hoalv3g/).

Have at it folks, but remember, the usual rules apply. Please keep it civil and report anyone posting misinformation or links to their propaganda.

Men's desire for sex is deep and carnal. It takes up a large portion of our mental bandwidth, and the longer we go without it, the more pent-up frustration we get that bleeds into other areas of our lives.

Women see sex like nice message - Is it nice to have? Sure, but it's not the end of the world if they go long periods without it. It's not uncommon for women to be celibate for years and not be distracted by it.

This is corroborated by the frequency of sex broken down by sexuality. Gay male couples have sex the most often, followed by heterosexual couples, and then lesbian couples.

The reasons for this disparity are likely due to women's menstrual cycle and the vast differences in testosterone levels between men and women.",CMV: Women don't desire sex nearly as much as men,2.0,2.0

sh9qhc,"I know everyone literally loves Lexi but i just don‚Äôt like her, specifically I don‚Äôt like the idea of the play, so far Lexi‚Äôs character in my opinion feels like her sister has always gotten all the attention, positive and negative. But when she has the opportunity of making a play about her self or her interests she creates a ‚Äúcomedy‚Äù play centered around her sister having a mental break down. Like yes Cassie is dumb and she does in fact create problems for herself MOST of the time but also, having two parents that are addicts is difficult, having an absent dad, getting an abortion at 17, constantly sexualizing herself for attention, (losing weight) depression ect. Are all valid reasons as to why a 17 year old would make horrible decisions.  maybe her classmates or even her friends wouldn‚Äôt understand those decisions but her sister of all people should at the very least not broadcast it to her entire school. I think it will be absolutely detrimental to Cassies life or at least her highschool friendships/relationships. 

Cassies puts on a show for everyone, her friends, boyfriends ect. The fact that her own sister is writing a play about her basically making fun of her is fucked up to me.  that‚Äôs all :) 

Also would like to add that I don‚Äôt believe Cassie has done anything (yet) to Lexi to deserve this.

Since this manager who is in the company for long years, has a brain in his pants he starts acting angry towards people she complains about without even hearing their stories. Recently I was assigned a project to work with this entitled person, she did not do any single thing about it.

rxkjcj,"Interesting thought popped up in meditation for me today. As my level of awareness develops I become more aware of the suffering and general insanity of the world. It's hard for me to see this realm as anything other then a hell realm now. A hell realm where suffering is the default, and little nuggets of pleasure and hope are fed to the inhabitants to keep them moving, but due to the impermanent nature of everything even the positive things like love, joy, and hope will all fade, back to the state of suffering. 

And so everyone is on this treadmill. Running away from pain. Running toward pleasure. But getting nowhere and exhausting themselves. 

I look around now and it feels like most are as the end of their energy. There's not much more to give.

So I wonder - have things changed in the world? Or are we simply waking up to the reality of a hell realm. To put it a different way - is the illusion that kept us asleep and ignorant to the reality of this place failing?

It makes me think of the Matrix movies. What if we've all only been here for a few years or decades. What if all of our history is fake. What if we were just dropped here with false memories of a pleasant and sane world. And all of that is an illusion. And all we've ever lived in is an insane hell world. And we are finally waking up to this fact.

Woke up before everyone, showered, waited for the kids to wake. I miss my plug, I hate the sound of Jack urinating in the toilet. I feel like I have purpose. I want to beg but that's a no no. Good sweet wives don't do such things.

Presents were great, M especially was ecstatic and squealed when she unwrapped her presents. S spent as much time with boxes as with what came inside. Baxter loved his presents as well, and at least one half of my life felt good and normal. Friends came over later, things were chill, until Jack and Heather disappeared into the bathroom for ten minutes. Tony smirked at me and I wanted him to punch me.

rx1uty,"Tried to keep this as brief as possible, but not omit any important details. Last week I went for lunch with a couple of friends. It was a lovely Melbourne Summer day so we arrived at the caf√© and put our name down for a table outside, waiting our turn for one \[table\] to become available. Like us, a couple of other groups who arrived subsequently followed suit. A line was forming for tables, a fairly standard situation during a lunch rush.

I noticed a nicely dressed person approach and ask for a table, the staff were busy, so requested that she wait. The front of house (who was allocating the tables) wasn't inconspicuous, this girl made a faint attempt to speak to them, but as she noticed a table became available, she went and sat down (skipping the line so to speak). I noticed a gentleman on the table next to her communicate with her, so I assumed they knew each other (hence why she sat there). But the next 10-15 mins of dialogue was something I had never seen/experienced before in my life.  

Being next in line, we were informed that the newly vacated table was in fact ours, and we'd be able to have it  once cleaned. The staff cleaned the table, put a reserved sign on it (for us), and gently explained to the girl who had sat down, that the table was for our group. But she refused to move. Her rationale was that ""ohh I was told I will be able to sit down when a table is ready"". The next 10 mins was followed by a few people (including us) trying to explain to her that she had jumped the line, and in fact, she was sitting on our table. We were all told that we could sit down when a table is ready, but there is a line. Turns out, the gentleman who spoke to her as she sat down, wasn't a friend, and was also informing her that she needed to put her name down for a table......

She still refused to move! Her rationale was the same ""oh nobody told me""..... Yeah mate, nobody told you that you could sit down either! I couldn't believe the entitlement on display here, and I was trying to reconcile in my head the series of events that would make someone think this behaviour is appropriate. I kept thinking to myself, fair enough, people make mistakes, maybe she didn't realise there was a line, but if someone pointed out that this was the case, wouldn't any functioning person acknowledge the error and wait their turn in line? Nobody was telling her to go to the back of the line, everyone was just explaining that she needs to wait her turn.

Eventually, it took another table to free up for her to move. The waiting staff look jaded, and all the surrounding tables looked perplexed listening to this conversation/interaction. Has the recent years of isolation made us forget how to act in a social setting? or is this kind of entitled / shitty behaviour just more evident now? I don't know the answer, but I do know this was the most baffling, comedic yet infuriating experiences I've ever had going to a cafe/restaurant.

rvsl1o,"I posted last month that I had a threesome planned on my summer holiday. Well I'm back home now and have time to update!

I saw a bit of both guys over new years but we were generally doing our own thing with mates until I got a text on 1st Jan asking if I wanted to come out on Lake Wanaka with them the next day. He ended the text with 'just the three of us', I quickly said yes.

It was super hot on the 2nd, I tried to make myself as presentable as possible in my wheelchair - black bikini underneath a short dress. Once they had me loaded into the boat we headed up the lake in search of a beach and quickly started drinking, I'd already had a couple of drinks before they picked me up to help my nerves. It didnt take long before the one who wasnt driving (Harry) had slid right next to me and had his hand on my leg (btw it is always funny not feeling a hand rubbing my thigh and then suddenly noticing it and getting a bit of a fright).

We were maybe 10-15 mins driving by this point, still lots of other boats around all heading to find a patch of beach somewhere.

His mate (Jack) kept turning to look at us while we were all chatting and I could tell he was focused on what Harry was doing. Feeling in the swing of things I reached over and started rubbing and squeezing his cock and from there it was quickly all go!

Harry took me by surprise and dropped onto his knees in front of me so he was down in the boat and spreading my legs and pulling me towards him. He started rubbing my pussy through my bikini, then slid his fingers inside, before pulling my bottoms off and kissing and kicking me. The whole time Jack kept driving us further up the lake away from other boats and people while he watched the two of us.

Looking around I couldn't see many other boats anymore and I started to relax and enjoy myself, since oral doesnt do much for me I told Harry to fuck me right there. Jack heard me say it and immediately stopped the boat and half pushed Harry out of the way saying 'my turn'. His cock was hard from watching and he crouched in front of me and slid inside. I rubbed my clit and tits while he started fucking me hard into the seat. Harry watched for a bit then I watched as he looked around for onlookers and dropped his own shorts and sat beside me.

I started stroking his dick and we were kissing side by side while Jack fucked me. I dont know how long that lasted but not long before Jack blew inside me and pulled out. Harry quickly tried to pick me up and pull me up on top of him forgetting my legs dont cooperate. I actually fell over the other side of him lying across his lap and seat laughing.

We got me lying on my back across the seat legs spread and Harry got on top of me and started to fuck me deep and slow. We fucked like that for a while and when Jack had recovered he came over and put his cock in my face which I sucked and licked until he was hard again.

I fucking loved how dirty that was with two cocks in me and had my first orgasm on that position and Harry gave me my second load of the day.

The next hour or two was a little more tame, drinking and chatting, though I noticed we drove a long way away from any other boats on the lake. When we stopped again Harry pulled my dress over my head and bikini top off so I was naked and they followed suit.

After a lot of kissing and heavy petting Harry told me that he had told Jack about last time we fucked and that I let him fuck me in the ass, he said Jack had never done anal and would I let him.

If you've read any of my other posts you'll know I have been experimenting lots with toys in my ass so I was definitely keen for this.

They flipped me over so I was face down on the seat and Jack started to fuck my pussy from behind, I could feel something inside my ass which would have been a finger or two until eventually he filled me up and I could feel his cock hitting deep in my ass. I wriggled a hand underneath me and fingered myself and rubbed my clit but he came before me.

Harry had been sitting beside us watching and rubbing his cock, while he was sitting there he told Jack to carry me over and sit me on him. Jack picked me up and sat me in Harry's lap so I was facing away from him. Harry slid into my ass right there and started fucking me from underneath. I felt like such a slut, second cock in my ass, tits bouncing around and rubbing my own clit in full view. I had a huge orgasm then moaning and shaking and Harry came in my ass as well.

So I got two loads in my pussy and two in my ass, Harrry got seconds both times but gave me both of my orgasms.

We never actually got off the boat at a beach, eventually heading back to the boat ramp with their cum inside me. They did take me back to their place and help me get cleaned up before returning me to my friends.

sgcmku,"About a month ago, I found out both of my children where the results of my soon to be ex-wives affairs. I've had a feeling for awhile now that both them were not mine. 6 years ago when my son was born, I was the happiest I had been in my entire life. I had married my best friend, we had a child together, and everything seemed amazing.

That was until he started getting older. After a few years, I started to have doubts that he was actually mine. He did not look like my child. The more he started to grow, the more I realized just how different he looked compared to what I would expect a child of mine to look like. I am not petty or paranoid enough to let that alone drive me. It was my whore of a wife that really set my alarms off.

Whenever she went out, she never went where she said she did. She would have huge holes in her schedule she could never explain to me, she would refuse to allow me to interact with anyone from her work place, and a close friend of hers accused her of flirting with her s/o at the time. It did not help that soon after our son was born, her lies started to catch up with her. Still though, I loved her like the fool I was. She told me up and down how much she loved me whenever one of her lies caught up with her. She had convinced me that despite the fact she was a lying and manipulative woman, that she wasn't a lying manipulative whore.

Last year, she got pregnant again, and I still held out a small bit of hope that it was mine. But when her daughter was born, it was obvious she was mixed race. I refused to sign the birth certificate, and the paternity test I demanded afterwards proved my suspicions right all along. Neither of them are mine.

The day I got those test results were the day I filed for divorce from that whore and walked away from the family I had created. I knew that it would destroy her sons life to see me walk out. Despite my concerns, I was the best dad I could be to him.  I loved him with all my heart and put in 110% into being the father he deserved. Now though, when I see him I am filled with disgust. Disgust for my whore of a wife, disgust with myself for not trusting my instincts, and disgust that the last 6 years on my life have been for nothing. I have been told by multiple people now that I am a monster for leaving ""my son"" like this. My ex has tried on multiple occasions since I moved out to use him to guilt me into getting back with her. She will have him call me at random hours of the night crying and begging for ""his daddy"" to come back. The day I moved out, she paraded him into the room as I packed my things to show me ""how much damage I am doing."" In every conversation that he is brought up, both online and off, I am berated and shamed. That despite the fact I am not the boys biological father, I am his dad.

What I have sadly now realized is that, to most, my own feelings mean nothing. My parents are my only supporters through all this, with my own siblings calling me a despicable person for abandoning a child like that. My feelings of betrayal and sadness mean nothing, because a child is involved. I know it is not his fault. I know that the man he called his father for his entire life just walked away, But why am I expected to ""man up?"" Why should I have to pretend everything is fine and I do not feel contempt for this entire situation. Why should I put my own life and feelings aside? I never was the boys father, I loved him like one and honestly still do; but I would come to hate and contempt him if I had to play that role. Hate myself for not standing up and taking my own life back into my own hands. He is not my child, and even though it is not his fault, he is not my problem anymore.

&#x200B;

Edit:

Wow, this post certainly blew up. Guess airing my dirty laundry accomplished something. Anyway, i've seen a few common questions so I'll just answer them here.

1.) Her son knows the truth of why I left. I sat down and told him that I am not his father, and that his mother lied to me and cheated on me. i made it clear I am not mad at him, that it is not his fault this is happening, and no matter what I will still think he's an amazing kid.

2.) Some are saying that I never loved him, or was always looking for a way out. It's hard to convey emotions in a text post like this, and even harder to allow vitriolic hatred towards your whore of a wife decontextualize the last 6 years of your life. You can believe what you want though.

3.) I have a lawyer, and I'm not going to be paying child support or alimony.

Last though, for those who say I should stay in her sons life and be his father. That's not realistically possible. I do not hate him, but I have been cheated on, lied too, and used by a vile self-centered whore who has now caught her children up in her lies and deceit. He is a casualty of her actions, and blameless. However, it can never change the fact of the harsh reality we find ourselves in. I don't hate him, I feel so sad when I think about how he feels. But, all I see when I look at him is 6 years of my life I was lied to. 6 years of my life I was used. And 6 long years of built up doubts and frustrations with a woman who used me. There is no putting aside my hatred to try and be in his life, because the life I lived with him was nothing more than a fa√ßade cultivated by his mother. This is the harsh reality I find myself dealing with, and I simply cannot in good faith put myself or him through it any more.

&#x200B;

Edit 2:

Since I am seeing many armchair lawyers in the comments saying this post is fake on grounds of what I said above. I will not reveal what state I live in, but I am currently going through a fun legal process called disestablishment of paternity. Won't shut up 90% of you who think google makes you a lawyer but at least I tried.

&#x200B;

Edit 3:

This is going to be my last edit before I move on from this small little distraction I created for myself. First, I want to thank everyone for their kind words to me. In the comments, the DM's, and the chat. You have given me a bright day for the first time in a while. I wish I could reply to all of you, but I cannot thank you enough. 

Secondly, I have noticed many people criticizing the word I used very profusely to describe my soon to be ex. I want to just say, the place I am now is one of the darkest I have been in my life. I see nothing but white hot rage for the woman who ruined my life. Is what I said inappropriate? Is the word I used to describe her dehumanizing and vile? Yes. I will admit that. But I won't apologize for it. What I wrote here today was the truth of the world as it is for me right now. It is the raw unadulterated stream of consciousness of a flawed man. I do not intend to try and get people to hate women, or to push some misogynistic message about how women are terrible. That is not my goal here, and that is not the message of this post. I understand why people do not like the word I used here, and you know what I accept that as a valid criticism of what I did here today. 

I came here today to simply find some outlet for the situation I find myself in. To rant, mourn, and deal with the complex and raw emotions that have torn me apart for the last month. A place where I can freely speak my mind. And you know what, I did that. 

Today was pretty alright thanks to you guys.

Again to everyone who showed me love and support, thank you from the bottom of my flawed heart. To those who came here disagreeing with me but showed me respect, thank you as well. After the shame and ridicule I face in my real life, the respect you showed me despite your disagreement was nice.

So long, and thanks for all the fish.","They're not my kids, and not my problem.",2.0,2.0

ry2ubm,"Teenage me thought all dudes could suck themselves off. One horny night as a teenager I decided I was going to try, and it was about an inch from my mouth. So I stretched every night and finally got a bit of it in. 

Fast forward 6 years later and I‚Äôm hanging with a big group of guys and the topic of sucking yourself came up and we all admitted to attempting. And I realized none of them had said they had actually succeeded. I asked them if any one had actually done it and literally none of them had. And at that point they realized I had and clowned me so hard for it.

So, what did you think was normal for guys but turned out it wasn‚Äôt?

Edit some of my findings from the answers: 
- everyone wants you to wash your ass dude, and if you already do, good on you 
-a lot of you have sucked your own dick
- a lot more of you have attempted
- 3 dudes have dreams about sucking themselves
- lots of people thought all men wished they were girls, so to the ones that did: thank you for bringing the population up and giving me a bigger shot at finding a woman
- poo knife
- there‚Äôs a guy that catches his own shit and then drops it in the toilet? Like what
- some people men think wiping is gay? Like sir wait till I tell you about what you have to hold while pissing

If women cared about n-count it would be another of the female standards that men moan about. What do men moan about? They moan about the height standard, when women say ''We cant tall guys'' it's not just words, that's followed up with actions. If you're a short guy you're going to see and feel the difference compared to the tall guys. Men moan about the money standard, again, women saying they want rich guys isn't empty words, they really put that desire into practise with their decisions and broke guys will feel it. I have never heard a man complain about anything aproximating an n-count standard, that's something *women* complain about. So if women care about n-count, it's in the same way that people 'care' about unethical business practises behind the products they continue to purchase, ie not to an extent that actually matters for anything.

The question then is, why is this claim made? My theory is that it's basically women offering men a scam deal - ''let's both drop this sily n-count standard, deal?''. This would be like men collectively saying to women:

''we'll agree to stop expecting you to make lots of money if you agree to stop expecting us to make lots of money''

to which women might naturally reply:

''you already don't expect that, so we don't get anything out of this deal. You want us to drop a real standard that we viscerally care about, and in exchange you're offering to drop a fake standard that you're only pretending to have for the purposes of this exchange''",Women pretending to care about n-count is an angle.,2.0,2.0

s3xcw4,"I bought a house seven years ago and I met my fiance, Al, four years ago This year he moved in. We're talking about making it a home for both of us.

But as of now, he hasn't moved much stuff in, right now 95% of the stuff and furniture in the house is mine. 

When his mom comes over, she's kind of a snoop. He was used to that, but when she comes to our house, it's so uncomfortable because she's just going through my shit. 

When I am bothered, she's like ""I was just helping with chores"" etc. He says I should just let her because she has ""a lot of nervous energy"" 

One thing she snooped on was actually embarrassing. In my home office, I had a little ""affirmation"" post it note on my monitor saying ""I am smart, I am skilled, I am deserving of great things"" It was a silly thing my therapist recommended to get me in a confident mindset before an interview. 

Anyway, she made a comment to about my ego... 

But as a joke, I decided to do it again. I had my best friend over and we got wine drunk and wrote a bunch of ""affirmations"" to hide.

Some were:

Medicine cabinet: My teeth will regrow! I am sharklike and powerful!

Kitchen drawers: I know when to spoon, but I also know when to fork! I am sexy and self assured!

Work desk: I will not just fuck my way to the top of the company, I will fuck my way to the top of the world! 

Walk in closet: I am beautiful with clothes and without! Especially without! My boobs are legendary!


There were a bunch more, and my friend and I had a hilarious time writing them. 

Next time my MIL came over she saw a few. And she didn't acknowledge them to me even though she definitely started acting a little weird about me. 

I went to run some errands and when I was out, she confronted Al about the notes and was trying to tell him that I seemed unstable, egotistical, and moving in was a bad idea. She showed him the notes and he didn't really know what to make of it. 

He asked me and I said that they were just some silly private notes to boost my self confidence and make myself laugh; how had she gotten them? Had she been going through my things? 

He said she was just tidying, and saw them. And they were real weird.

I was like 'have you met me? You should know how weird I am. Anyway if you don't want your mom seeing my weird shit you've got to stop letting her go through my shit""

He asked if I left them on purpose to annoy her, and I admitted that was kinda the joke, but I also have other weird or private shit so what I said about her needing to stop snooping if she didn't want to find weird crap was still for real.

He said I was making stuff hard for him, his mom was really protective and adjusting to him moving in with a girlfriend for the first time, and I was agitating her on purpose and making her think I wouldn't be a good partner, when he wanted her to have the opposite impression of me!

#Elyse

The journey was long, though not very eventful. With the gold Elyse got from her father, the girl and her brother chartered a journey on a merchant ship. Once they escaped Grandview, in the dead of night - it was almost too easy, and Ely believed it thanks to her perfect planning - and got to the port, all went well.

Elyse, Edrick and Better Dacy, Ely's blue-and-gold Macaw from the Summer Islands, quickly grew bored. But that much was expected, when they had to sail almost all around the Continent...

Finally, the air started growing noticeably colder, and the children knew they were coming to the North's shores. What they didn't realise, was just how big the Kingdom of the North was. Even after passing the Cape Kraken, they still had a long journey to go. Weeks passed before the ship finally docked on Bear Island.

They disembarked, almost running, excited as they were - unlike Better Dacy. The large blue parrot was repeating ""Bearrrr! Bearrr!"" all the while, but looking around as much as they could, Elyse and Edrick could not see a single bear.",[Event] Do what I can to survive. Do what I can to cut ties.,2.0,2.0

s9mh42,"First what is a ""Boomer""? 

Urban slang being what it is translates this to being a ""Baby Boomer"", but many of these kids today FAIL MAJOR to understand that a ""baby boom"" happens at the end of wars typically!! And THAT SAID, a true ""baby boomer"" is a person who is the child OF somebody who fought in a war, and served in the military....something that my father did NEITHER OF!

I was actually born BETWEEN wars!! So technically I am NOT a ""boomer""! And like I just said my father was never in the military and never fought in ANY wars!! And to drive this point home The Korean War was over and Vietnam had not even started yet when I was born to put things out there! 

My point here is my grand daughter a while back called me a ""boomer"" even though I technically am NOT a product of a ""returning soldier""!! And it is clear to me the school system is majorly failing to teach even the basics of history to our next generations!! 

Other older kids are just as ignorant as I had a 25 year old ask me one day a few years ago ""What was the original Woodstock like?"" and I just looked at him wondering why he'd ask me that!! 

After all I was only 4 years old in 1969 ""The Summer of Love"" and in a few months I'd turn five years old! AND my parents weren't exactly acid trippin' hippies either! We didn't even live in a school bus and dad worked in a steel mill that made transmission parts and my mom was a stay at home, who ran a day care center basically!

A lot of kids today think automatically I am a ""boomer"" because I am old! They also seem to ignore other key facts about my like and the world I have lived in!! I just read a REDDIT here where a person wrote ""How Do Boomers Not See The Issue"" and they assume because I am a 57/M that my life and jobs have been some how ""easy""!! And they further claim that jobs 30, or 40 years ago ""paid well"" and you could support a family of four on a SINGLE INCOME which hasn't been the case in almost 60 years now!! 

Many of us who like me, hit the work force in the late 1970s to mid 1980s, learned a number of ""new words"" like ""Corporate downsizing"" which didn't actually mean the company was getting smaller as much as it meant corporate greed was shipping manufacturing jobs off to India, Japan, Mexico, and China! And another phrase added to our vocabulary was ""Temporary Agency"" where you could get a job, work 10 to 16 hours a day, 6 or 7 days a week while earning $5 an hour to do it, without raises, promotions, retirement packages, vacation, medical insurance and your only ""motivation"" was to ""not get fired or laid off""! And thus adding another phrase to our new work vocabulary as well.......the dreaded ""Laid Off""! Many companies used temporary agencies to side step federal regulations on employment as well too!! Hire a temp keep him for 3 years then lay him off, once his contract was up and then repeat this with a new temp! Personally I have been laid off roughly 30 times in my life, and some times I would work 2 months on the promise I was going to be hired permanent only to get laid off a week before my promised ""hire date""! 

And the work I was doing was back breaking work! Lifting 50 pounds all day long some days 16 hours a day straight even on Thanksgiving day! Didn't matter, because the alternative was ""Come In or be terminated!""!! Your choice!!! And $5 an hour doesn't go far when you are still earning that same money after ten years with any temporary agency of YOUR CHOICE either! One temporary agency demanded I take a ""one night only job"" that was for just four hours long, and would pay me $5 an hour, BUT I had to drive 60 miles one way to get to it, in a 4 wheel drive truck!! 

Basically it would have cost me more in gas to just get to that job, for what they were willing to pay me, for four hours, and then I would have had to wait two weeks for my $20 paycheck!! Try raising a family on that!!!!! 

I have a friend who worked for IBM for 18 years straight as a temp, for just $6 an hour, which wasn't bad money, but it certainly was buying him a Rolls Royce either! Then one day out of the blue they handed him his papers and told him ""Good luck in the future""!! Talk about a slap in the face for being a ""loyal worker""!! 

A company I worked at built a new building that held more people, and could get more work done, and a week before Thanksgiving called all 25 of us temps into the conference room to brag up these facts THEN proceeded to lay us ALL OFF at the same time as a group! And ignore the fact that I had to drive 28 miles ONE WAY a day to get to this job, but the pay was $6.50 an hour with three day weekends (every two weeks) and 12 hour a day shifts!! 

Another company I worked for demanded I work 6 days a week, 12 hours a day, and my job was pushing and pulling 2000 pound mail skids around all day! Imagine working in 120 degree heat, in heavy work boots, pushing a car around every 15 to 20 minutes for 12 hours a day, six days a week, and only earning $6 an hour to do it!! 

My point is you can't assume that older people had it ""easy"" and some how made money hand over fist! A lot of us were still working at a time when raises to the average worker salary hadn't been paid in nearly 30 years. And we were still earning near or just slightly above what the poverty was considered at the time!! It really sucks when you are earning just a nickel more an hour then what you need to get Food Stamps!! And making matters far, far worse, if you worked over time, which in some cases WAS MANDATORY, the government would take what you earned in over time for taxes literally leaving you working at times 60 hours a week for ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!! And companies got away with this all the time!!! They still do in some ways!! 

And like my parents I would do work for people at my home as ""side jobs"" on what was supposed to be my ""day off""! So I was constantly too busy to work on my own car or house or even raise my own kids, because most days I was working nearly 24/7 with about 4 hours of sleep a night wondering how to make ends meet!! And you get burned out pretty fast when you realize you have never actually had a ""day off"" because the day you took off last month was running your sick kid to the doctors, or you were installing a car stereo in a friends car for $30 in beer money! AND your wife who you seldom see because when she isn't sleeping around behind your back, is also working at a dead end job, which she actually earns two to three times more than you do!! Then she brags about taking two or four hour naps at work in the bathroom, because her company has no female bosses!!

Yeah this is the WORLD I lived in, so if you want to trade, I will gladly sit in an air condition office playing virtual golf and online shopping, as I do what ever it is you think is ""hard work""! Many of these jobs today isn't lifting, bending or twisting all day, and you certainly are not standing on your feet in steel toed work boots, for some days 16 hours straight, while you are degraded and belittled by a boss calling you ""lazy"" because I almost got your arm ripped off either! And at some companies I had to actually take my work home with me and continue doing work at home even after coming off a 14 hour shift, and I would still have to mow the lawn, take my son to football practice, pick my daughter up from girl scouts, stop and get groceries and run a load of laundry, just so my fat wife could sit on the phone complaining to her friends about how lousy I am, and her weight problems, while she ALSO watched repeats of FRIENDS and drinking a couple gallons of Diet Pepsi, and smoking a carton of cigarettes!! Then she would complain to YOU how hard her job was all day, inspecting screws in a circuit board!!

I have a 22 year old daughter (Chloe), her mom and were never married. Because of circumstances that I couldn't be in her life for long...then, her mom got married when she was 5 to her stepdad who is a somewhat decent guy, nosy but decent.


I came back to the country when Chloe was 16, and she was open to the idea of rebuilding our relationship. though, her mom always throws in my face that Chloe's stepdad is ""the real/legal parent"" and has always been to Chloe but she knows about the bond I have with Chloe or the things I'd gone through in the past so I ignore her judgemental remarks.



Chloe's getting married come Feb, I was taken back when she told me she was considering having me AND her stepdad walk her down the aisle, I went to have a conversation with her to talk about how uncomfortable I was with this idea. she talked about how her stepdad played huge part in her life and how she wanted to honor that by including him. I told her of course and I absolutely won't invalidate her feelings or deny how much of a good influence her stepdad's been but, I just don't feel comfortable with it and told her it'd be ok if I was just a guest there, but she said she wants me to be part of this so bad. I said it's either me or her stepdad because there is no way I'm doing this with him. she thought that was petty but it wasn't, she got upset saying it wasn't okay of me to put her in this position and make her choose and force her hand but really, ultimately, the choice is hers so how am I forcing her hand?.


She complained about how I was ruining her wedding and making it about my resentment towards her stepdad. The argument escalated to the point where I said I won't come to the wedding if she continues to force the issue.


Her mom contacted me calling me selfish, jealous, spiteful and whatnot claiming I was willing to hurt Chloe's feelings out of spite just because she dared show appreciation for the man who stepped up and was more of parent to her more than I'll ever be. I told her ""stay out of it...you're the reason we're having this problem, stay out of it this is between me and Chloe"". Chloe isn't answering my phonecalls, I tried speaking to her fiance and he said Chloe is upset by the fact I put my feelings above hers and disrespected her stepdad by asking her to choose between us. he advised me to do this one thing for her since it's important but I'm feeling uneasy even thinking about so I don't think I'll ever be okay with it.","AITA for ""making"" my daughter choose who she wants to walk her down the aisle (me, or her stepdad)?",2.0,2.0

Recently Jasmine was packing for a business trip. Todd was getting mad at her for packing bikinis and telling her she shouldn't need that on a work trip.

Todd asked me since I ""work in the industry"" if that is normal. I said I have no idea what is normal and have never been on a business trip. He kept pushing and asked if I would pack a bikini if/when i do go on one. I was honest and said I would never wear a bikini in front of people I work with and personally wouldn't be comfortable.

s544a9,"I used to always take my grocery carts back to the rack until recently. It was literally 20 degrees outside and I had to park far in the back of the parking lot because there were lots of cars. I got my groceries and came back to my car and put them in and realized I would had to walk ALL the way to the front back there weren‚Äôt any cart racks besides at the front of the parking lot. This would‚Äôve taken my at least 5-10 minutes to walk all the way there and back. Keep in mind it‚Äôs 20 degrees outside, getting late, I had a long day and was tired because I worked out hard at the gym. I just left the cart.

I know it‚Äôs not really what I should‚Äôve done, but I see it this way. Stores hire employees specifically to put carts away. Why should the customer have to inconvenience themselves by doing a task that employees are supposed to do? The point is to give great customer service and make things as easy as possible for the customer. 

With that being said, maybe if grocery stores learn to put more racks so that it takes me just a few seconds to put the cart back, maybe I‚Äôll go ahead and start putting them back. But until then, they‚Äôll go right where I leave them.

6oh568,"Jamie Santos was 27-years-old when she was found murdered, suffocated in her own home, on the morning of October 28, 1991 in Wheeling, Illinois. She worked as an exotic dancer, preforming at private parties and often raked in thousands of dollars a week. The night of the 27th, however was different. Jamie canceled her bookings, deciding to stay in. She rented a few movies, and called a friend (although I could find no info on who she called).  

The next morning, at 11:31 am, a 911 call came in. Police rushed to the scene, arriving in only 5 minutes, but  it was too late. Jamie was discovered unresponsive, fully dressed and lying on the floor. Her head was neatly propped up on a pillow. Paramedics attempted to revive her, but were unable to. There was no sign of forced entry, no sign of a struggle, and Jamie was not sexually assaulted.  Investigators eventually determined Jamie had been smothered with her pillow. A few fingerprints were discovered and sent in for testing, but ultimately, there were no matches. 

To date, the most substantial clue investigators have acquired is the 911 call, phoned in by an unidentified man, mere blocks from Jamie Santos' home, from a pay phone at a local liquor store. While investigators have a clear recording of the tape, and have played it in the media repeatedly since the '90s, the man in the phone call's voice has yet to be recognized. 

Here is a transcription of the call, though I highly recommend listening to it (I've linked it below), if able:

**Operator #1:** 911, Emerge

**Caller:** Yeah, uh, send an ambulance or police, or someone, to 1765 Stonehedge Court in Wheeling, immediately.  There's one young woman there who's not breathing. She's turning blue. 

**Operator #1:** All right, just hold on a minute, alright? Because, this is Buffalo Grove, just a minute. Hold on just a minute, OK? I'm going to try and transfer you, hold on a second. 

**Operator #1:** Hello?

**Caller:** 1765-

**Operator #1:** Hold on just a minute

**Caller:** No, no, no! There's no time! 

**Operator #2:** (Inaudible)

**Caller:** Yeah, get someone to 1765 Stonehedge Court in Wheeling, immediately. There is a young woman there who is not breathing. She is turning blue. 

**Operator #1:** 1765 Stonehenge? 

**Caller:** Stonehedge, HEDGE, like a bush. 

**Operator #1:** Okay, in Wheeling? 

**Caller:** Yeah.

**Operator #1:** What phone number are you calling from? 

**Caller:** Oh, I don't know. it's a public phone. 

**Operator #1:** All right, Wheeling, can you hear me? This is Buffalo Grove 911. 

**Operator #2:** Yeah, I can barely hear you.

**Operator #1:** All right, are you calling from an address in Buffalo Grove? 

**Caller:** Yeah.

**Operator #1:** And when were you at that home, sir?

**Caller:** Bye.

**Operator #1:** Sir?

**HANGS UP**


Police initially theorized the caller was not the murderer, but simply a witness. Why would the murderer call 911? To investigators, it didn't make sense. 

There were also some conspicuous indicators that the caller knew Jamie Santos. He had her exact address memorized, up to the unusual HEDGE in Stonehedge, rather than Stonehenge. Also, since there were no signs of forced entry, Jamie most likely let her killer in willingly. 

A video tape of a man standing outside the liquor store where the call was made from was investigated, but the man seen in the footage was cleared. 

Since then there have been little to no leads in the case, but the 911 call continues to circulate... Do you recognize this voice? Do you think this is the man who killed Jamie, or did he just stumble upon the crime?

[Recording Starts at 1:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEH_C9XwL40)

Also, if anyone has a better link of the 911 call, please share, that's the only one I could find anywhere :(

We all watched this shitshow where Josh fucking Sargent scored a Brace. Not 1. But 2 goals. Of course he had never scored before making it more poetic. 
Of course as normally happens, floodlights go off in the middle of the game, as a result 15 Fucking minutes were added to the regular 90. 15 additional minutes.

Now to address the elephant in the room, Emmanuseless Dennis. 45% captained in the Top 10k. Of course a DGW of Norwich and Burnley what could go wrong? Except Dennis decided to be an idiot and got 2 useless yellows and got sent off in a usesless fashion netting a hual of -1 and -2 for us captainers.

1st buy - Sheen + Zerks

Core - ER + Shieldbow (Kraken only if you uberstomp)

Finish the build: Zhonias, BT, Wits End, GA, IE (only if you feel funky)

""WTF are those random items?!"" - In the late game, as soon as you turn on the ult, there's no need for insane damage from items. This ability gives you all the damage you need. So, in order to secure the win you need two things:
1. Tons of sustain
2. Good early game

Shieldbow+Zhonias+Wits+BT never failed to keep me alive, so we have the 1st one answered.
In terms of the early game, Sheen item seems to be a great powerspike early on. Triforce and Sunderer may be better on 1 item, but crit seems to be better on 2 + infinite mana sustain on ER is irreplacable.

scdl4g,"This may be an incredibly personal opinion, but it‚Äôs one I‚Äôve never stopped thinking about. 

When I was 16 years old, I was forced to go to a gyno by my abusive ‚Äúmother‚Äù (I have since disowned her and really hate using that to reference her). I had given a boy I was interested in a bj (my first sexual experience as well) and somehow they found out and punished me - on Thanksgiving they brought me into their room and berated me in front of both my sets of grandparents, and my aunts and uncles. I was called a multitude of names, slut shamed, etc. As if that wasn‚Äôt traumatic enough, I was then told I would be visiting a gyno against my will to make sure I was still a virgin. 

I was not given a choice in my doctor, and had a 36 year old man. It was incredibly invasive, I was not prepared in any way and to have a man 20+ years my elder scarred me for life. He then proceeded to tell them I was ‚Äútorn up‚Äù down there, that my hymen was ‚Äúdestroyed‚Äù, and I was clearly having intercourse. All of it was a lie, and the punishment I got because of it haunts me. 

Years later, when I was 18, I went back and chose a woman to see me. Without prompting, she told me I looked great, and that my hymen, when it broke, would probably be a little tender. I cried and asked her if she could really tell that, and she said of course. I would and should have sued, but I was too young and scared back then. 

There is nothing like having your privacy violated unwillingly, and grown men should not be allowed to see a minor as a patient when it comes to gynecology.

Editing ~ I clearly should have made the title something different. I just mean, adult men and adult women should not *want* to be the doctor for an underage minor needing their downstairs checked. There‚Äôs a lot of controversy surrounding this being sexist and that wasn‚Äôt my intention, but I don‚Äôt have a different view on the matter on the other side of all this.
No, I don‚Äôt think adult men should see a female minor, and no, I don‚Äôt think adult women should see a male minor. Sexuality isn‚Äôt part of the point, in no way did I infer he was hitting on me or trying to get a look at my goodies. I was saying as a young girl, and on top of it not having a choice, I wish the one person that did have a choice outside my situation had said no to seeing me as he was a man, and referred us instead to a female doctor.

~ I 100% believe that he was in on it, and that my parents had told him to say the things he said in order to shame me further and be able to punish me how they saw fit. After the visit, I was required monthly to show my bloody pads or tampons to prove I wasn‚Äôt pregnant. 

Thank you for those that were kind enough to see the point I was genuinely trying to make, and I‚Äôm glad you had good male gyno experiences. Trust me, I know how vile women can be, one of them was my mother once. But if I had been given a choice, I would have chosen a woman, and made up my own mind based on that experience to see if I wanted a different doctor or not. My gyno now is the first I‚Äôve seen in 8 years following that incident, and she has been very kind and supportive of my trauma. She asks all the right questions, is privy to my past, and has been incredibly helpful in my growth beyond this pain.",Men should not be allowed to be gynecologists to a minor,2.0,2.0

It‚Äôs an understatement when we say that this subreddit has grown incredibly toxic. It‚Äôs near impossible to have a simple discussion without insults being flung around at each other -  and it‚Äôs really starting to harm the entire Battlefield community, and each of us that are part of it.  We mods have always been very laid back as far as moderation goes - we try our best to let everyone‚Äôs voice be heard, no matter how upset or angry, but we‚Äôve always been of the position that insults or harassment directed to any individual will never be tolerated. We‚Äôll do whatever it takes to drive that sort of toxicity down. If it means shutting down for a period of time, we will.  The mods have an obligation to follow the rules set out by Reddit, and if we are found to be in breach of not enforcing them, or doing a poor job at enforcing them, we risk the community getting banned altogether. 

With that said, here are the options we are  considering:

**Option 1)** If toxicity goes down, we will leave the subreddit open without further restrictions.

**Option 2)** If toxicity stays at current levels, we will begin locking threads early, on a majority of posts.

**Option 3)** If toxicity increases, we will lockdown the subreddit for a period of time.

Yes, the last two options seem nuclear, and we don‚Äôt want to use them, but we said we will do whatever it takes to drive the current toxicity down.  If that means you can‚Äôt comment in the majority of posts, or you can‚Äôt view the subreddit for a period of time, we will go down that route.

This one is going up early. It's the Wednesday update, but I wanted to give it some extra time because, for the first time, there will be AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION! Read all about it after the break.

\*\*\*\*

 It was weird being inside the Hotel. Marin didn't spend a lot of time here, since she normally was shadowing Sammi or doing data analysis. Aside from visiting the pool (which she hadn't done since the sauna incident), there wasn't much reason to be here. She turned right at the entrance and made her way toward the medical wing. All the males had apparently banded together and were hiding out in Stace's apartment, so that's where she was heading. She had never actually been there, but she had an open invite and now was the time to use it.

She was surprised to find that Helkam commando, the one with the facial scar, sitting on a folding chair in the medical office. She had a rifle across her lap and on top of it a large red box of candies. The woman was in the process of stuffing her mouth when Marin walked in, and she did an impressive juggling act to get up and to attention without spilling anything. Marin gestured with her hand and the Helkam relaxed, putting the candies on the seat behind her.

""Vezpir, right?"" The commando nodded. ""Mind if I ask what you're up to?""

""Guarding the door."" Vezpir shrugged. ""It isn't really necessary but it makes the boys happy to know someone they trust is here. I don't mind it.""

""And the candy?""

""There's loads of it."" Vezpir gestured to the door that led to Stace's apartment. ""It's pretty crazy. Really makes you wonder if that sort of thing works. Just seems desperate to me."" Marin nodded. She wasn't quite sure what the other woman meant, but that was okay. She knocked and, hearing a muffled yell from the other side, entered into the strange anarchy that was Stace's living room.

The room was littered with piles of wrapped packages, cut flowers, and red and gold boxes of candy. It was like a trendy gift shop threw up all over the inside of an otherwise tasteful room. Askel and Samuel were there, sorting through the piles, and Marin was surprised to see Allis, her father-in-law, there with Ayen. He looked up and grinned at her entrance.

""Look out, boys! Marin's here."" Allis's smile was warm and friendly, eyes twinkling. ""Here to help protect us?""

""No, I just wanted to visit. What's all this... stuff?"" Her attention was drawn to motion out of the corner of her eye. Whatever it was, it was small and low to the ground but was gone as soon as she noticed it.

""Apparently Stace has made a name for himself. Lots of eligible young women looking to snag a husband."" 

There was that motion again. Something small, tan colored, coming straight for her. Marin felt her leg tense, preparing to punt the thing until it resolved into a tiny animal, a puff ball no larger than her hand with a tiny black nose and dark eyes. It made a quiet, high yipping noise and started playfully attacking her shoe.

""What is that thing?"" It was probably the single most masculine creature Marin had ever seen. It was about as threatening as a plate of waffles.

""A Pomeranian, I think."" Samuel was grinning. ""Someone sent her to Stace.""

""It's so cute!"" Allis clapped his hands and the little puff ran over to him. The male picked it up and let it lick his face. ""Who's a cute little puggy? It's you! Yes you are!""

""Puppy,"" Sam corrected. ""A pug is a different type of dog.""

""And the rest of this....?"" Marin gestured at the drift piles of candy, the potted plants. The expensive looking packages.

""It's been coming in by the van load."" Ayen shrugged. ""I guess the people Stace saved felt really grateful. We're sorting it out for him.""

""Where is he?""

""Back in his bedroom."" Askel held up his omnipad. ""I'm keeping track of his vitals. He hasn't been doing too well since we got back from the hospital. He's got a mild sedative, some hot cocoa, and a few novels to read.""

""And how are you two doing?"" Marin took in Askel and Samuel with one sweep of her eyes. ""Jel'si sent Elera a message, she wants personal security for every male here after what happened.""

""We're holding up."" Askel shrugged, but he didn't look quite together. A bit haggard. ""Just need some time away from... yeah."" He gave Marin an apologetic smile. She understood what he meant in a sudden burst of insight and her skin began to heat with embarrassment.

""I'm sorry. I can go.""

""No, it's okay."" The Helkam gave her a soft smile. ""I know you're safe.""

""I told you!"" Allis put the 'puppy' down and it ran off to sniff at some boxes. ""I would never have let Ayen marry her if Marin wasn't good people.""

""Dad, you didn't **let** me marry anybody. I told you we were getting married."" Ayen crossed his arms and tried to stare down his father. ""You didn't get a say in it.""

""Well, technically I raised you, so any decision you make reflects on what I taught you."" Allis's arms crossed the same way. ""So you approving of her means that I approved by proxy.""

A laugh rocked Samuel's slight frame. ""Those two have been at it all day.""

Marin moved a few boxes and took a seat on the couch next to Ayen, wrapping an arm around him and pulling her husband close. He made a surprised squeak before snuggling up tight.

""So, aside from a small animal, anything else interesting get sent this way?""

Allis lifted his omnipad. ""I've been keeping track of who sent what so we can write appropriate thank you letters. Lots of candy, some jewelry that's just my style but definitely **not** Stace's, the puggy..."" His thin finger delicately flicked at the screen. ""All those bouquets of cut flowers, of course. Some beautiful clothing that probably won't fit since Stace has womanly shoulders. One 'mah'ri wenna' plant, three mint plants, a Celestine micro-tree that's undoubtedly illegal to have on Earth, thirty two offers of marriage, forty seven offers of a more carnal nature, though there's a lot of overlap there...""

""I think I get the idea."" A tugging on Marin's ankle caught her attention. That little animal had a hold of one of her boot clasps in its tiny mouth and was trying desperately to overcome the strength of the fasteners. She leaned forward and scooped it up with one hand. It couldn't have weighed more than a kilogram. ""Has Stace seen this thing yet?""

""Not yet, though he might have heard her. We were debating whether or not we should wait to show him."" Samuel had a sheepish grin on his face. ""It's generally considered really damn rude to gift somebody a pet they will feel obligated to take care of, but I think Stace won't mind.""

Askel got up from his perch on one of the kitchen chairs he had dragged in and peeked into Stace's bedroom. ""He's asleep. With a book on his face."" 

Ayen let out a little giggle. ""Perfect!""

\--

Allis had never seen Stace's bedroom, but honestly he was impressed. Once he had a chance to get used to the rugged style that the Human seemed to prefer, he could admit that it was a well thought out room. He recognized it as a sort of reinterpretation of the cabin that Ayen had sent pictures of. He stood back and watched as the rest of the little group came in, Ayen holding the pugg... the puppy in his hands. His wives had said no more pets, but considering how cute and tiny the thing was Allis was sure he could change their minds. Maybe they came in trendier colors.

The human was laying in his bed. It was a proper Shil'vati bed, which meant Stace looked small and frail in the huge thing. Plenty of space for a wife or three to snuggle up with. Ayen plopped the puppy on the bed, then took out his omnipad to record a video as she jumped around in her new soft playground. Allis watched with one eye as he slowly slipped to the back of the room. This was a perfect time to do a little snooping.

The dresser drawer was surprisingly quiet as he slid it open, though he wasn't. Thankfully, nobody noticed his little yelp of surprise. The puppy had managed to climb on top of Stace and the human was just starting to realize that something was going on, providing the perfect distraction. Allis had time to look at the guns. Oddly enough, after what had happened at the bar, the Shil'vati was startled but he wasn't really bothered. Of course Stace would have guns. He had been living out in the dangerous wilderness and needed to protect his family. It was just, well... Allis had never even touched a weapon or any kind. He was tempted to reach in and pull one out, but that could be a catastrophically bad idea. Maybe Stace could give him lessons. Some male bonding, Human-style.

He slid the drawer closed and started on the next one, getting it opened only a couple of centimeters before a whispered voice stopped him.

""Allis!"" Marin was glaring at him, so he obligingly slid the drawer back closed. Spoilsport. She beckoned with her arm and he obediently moved up to the bed. Stace seemed enamored with the little animal. He was picking it up and tossing it gently backwards to a spot on the bed between his spread legs. Well, leg and a half. The puppy would run back up into his hands and he would toss it again.

""Whose pup is this?"" Stace seemed so excited, so... happy. It was a refreshing contrast compared to what Allis had seen when the boys got back from the hospital.

""Yours, care of... somebody. I'd have to look it up."" Samuel grinned. ""More presents have been coming in.""

Stace's smile filled his whole face, skin around his mismatched eyes crinkling. ""She's going to need a name.""

""I think the lady already has a name. It's on the card that came with the dog."" That was Samuel. He seemed nice, and Allis knew he was friends with Ayen. They got on well together, and whatever trouble the boys had gotten into at the hospital seemed to have washed away after some time spent socializing.

""You know what I meant.""

Of course, what Allis really wanted to do is look around some more. It was his first time on Earth, Stace was a new friend he needed to get to know better, and, well, he was nosy. It was a well documented fact. Unfortunately, Marin was keeping an eye on him so he was stuck near the bed. There wasn't too much interesting there. There was a medical monitor, some blankets, and... a bright blue strip of leather wrapped around the bedpost near Stace's head. Allis hadn't worn a collar in years; it had been trendy in his youth at some nightclubs and he could remember going out to dance with Renna and Terris. He flicked it gently with one finger until he could see the bright silver tag riveted to the leather: ""Loved by Daniel, Ayen, and Elera""

Huh.

\--

""I thought you gave up smoking."" Torel's voice was more curious than patronizing. Jel'si had been acting weird since that incident at the bar.

""I did."" Jel'si took a final drag on her herbal whatever and smashed out the stub in a disposable food container. She hadn't looked up from her display screens. They were covered in photos of various women, security camera footage, spreadsheets... just a tangle of information Torel really couldn't follow.

""I also thought you were planning on moving out of our compound and taking up residence at the Painter Facility."" That got Jel'si's attention.

""I never told you that.""

""No, but it's obvious."" Torel grinned. ""The curse of Chel'xa got you. You're starting to go human."" 

""I am not."" Jel'si pulled another cylinder from the pack and lit it. ""I am trying to come up with how to protect our investment.""

""You mean 'Stace'.""

Jel'si's reaction was immediate. Torel found herself stepping back as the woman swung her arm across the table, knocking empty food containers and assorted half-filled mugs to the floor. She slammed both of her fists onto the table hard enough that Torel thought she heard the native wood actually crack.

""YES, I MEAN STACE. Stace and Askel and Samuel and Ayen and all of them."" Jel'si was breathing hard, her eyes shining. ""Stace saved my life, and in the end I couldn't even protect that group of guys from getting sexually assaulted by idle little shits while they were stuck in a hospital room. Samuel did more to help than I could.""

Torel stepped forward again and put a hand on her sister-in-law's shoulder. ""It's alright. We'll get it all sorted. They're safe now."" She looked at the screens again. ""These are the ones?""

""Not sure yet."" Jel'si seemed to calm down a little as she turned back to the screens. ""I know everybody who was in the bar and the hospital was more than happy to give me the hallway security camera footage. Right now I'm trying to figure out which of these cunts actually went into the room. Narrowing it down.""

""Hmm. Doesn't sound that hard, honestly."" 

""It shouldn't be."" Jel'si went to press out her smoke, only to find that she had knocked all her potential ashtrays to the floor. With a sigh, Jel'si stood up from her seat and started picking up the mess. ""The problem is that Stace is famous now. The bar security video has been going around, and more than half of the people at the hospital weren't at the bar, possibly don't have any connection at all. It's making things more difficult if I want to keep this little side project quiet.""

Torel nodded. ""What will you do when you find the women involved? They're probably all nobles or high ranking military brats or the like. You won't be able to move openly.""

""I'm sure I'll think of something. At the very least, I'll know who to blacklist from visiting the Painter Facility. At worst, well...."" Jel'si gave Torel a tired smile. ""When you run a fine toothed comb through somebody's life, who knows what sort of nits will get dragged out into the light.""

Jessica's new apartment was horribly empty, but it was hers. She had a bed and a desk and a single chair, which meant tomorrow she was going to go into Durango for some furniture shopping. If she could find the time. At this point, she was happy to just have a place to crash.

It took all day for the Shil'vati techs with their hovering cranes to get the Hotel upgraded. Now both she and Commander Rem had their own apartments, there were another 20 human-sized rooms, plus a gym and bigger laundry facility. She also had to get catering set up for the new workers, make sure they had enough clean sheets... it was almost two in the morning and she needed rest. Jessica stood in her new kitchen, enjoying a pre-bed beer in her underwear when she heard a soft, tentative knock on her door. It was so quiet she wasn't sure she heard it.

When she popped the door open, forgoing the peep hole, she was surprised to see Askel standing there. His face was damp, and those eyes, green from edge to edge, were puffy from crying. His soft-looking blue pajamas were rumpled and in his arms was his leather jacket wrapped around a pillow. He didn't say anything, just stood there looking miserable. Jessica reached out, taking him gently by the arm.

""What's going on?"" He looked awful, his gray skin flat, hair oily.

""Couldn't sleep."" He let out a little sniff. ""Nightmares.""

""Well, come on. Let's get you relaxed."" Jessica guided him into the apartment and closed the door. It was only then that she remembered that she was in her underwear, but considering Askel hadn't seemed to have noticed she decided it was better to not bring it up. He needed affection more than she needed her modesty. The Helkam seemed sort of stunned. She took his pillow and put it on her chair, then lead him gently by the hand towards the bathroom.

""I don't want to... I mean I want to, but I'm not ready."" Askel's face flushed the color of charcoal and his eyes were downcast. 

""I know, it's okay. We're not going to do anything sexy."" At least not tonight. Definitely the wrong time for that. ""We're going to get in the tub with some bubble bath and cuddle, then we'll go to bed. I'll keep you nice and warm and safe, don't worry.""

Askel's head bobbed up and down in a nod. ""Okay."" That earned the little guy a hug, and he let himself be lead into the bathroom. Jessica had kept the shil'vati-size extra large tub when she designed the apartment, and soon the room was full of steam and the pleasant lavender smell of the bubble bath. She gently, carefully began the job of undressing her boy.

Askel was slim and slight, his gray skin broken up with patches of glossy black scales. Not overly muscular, just thin and soft. She slipped off his shirt, then guided his hands to the clasp on her bra. They were strangely cool, fingertips silk smooth. They both giggled as he struggled with the fasteners before she took over. Jessica made a point of not looking as she pulled down his pants, and after he did the same with her panties she led him into the tub.

In a few moments, they were situated. Jessica had her little Helkam sitting in her lap in the warm water, purring pleasantly as she gently scrubbed his scales with a loofah and ran her fingers through his hair. They didn't say anything, didn't have to say anything, and when they were done, clean and dry, entwined in Jessica's bed, their sleep was deep and full of pleasant dreams.

I am a female engineer. Studying undergrad at a really great university. In my program and basically every engineering program there is of course a huge divide in that there are way more men than women. In some of my classes there are like five girls to 20 guys, so of course the girls all become friends and stick together. I love them all but one of them just doesn't hold herself up to the standard that I feel engineers should.

I am in no way slut shaming her, but I've always felt that the outfits she wears to classes, labs and internship meetings are incredibly inappropriate. She'll wear skirts with the sheer tights underneath them, boots, low cut tops so you can see her cleavage too. It shames me when she walks into class and I see all the guys staring at her body, or whispering to each other, or whistling under their breath. We're already so outnumbered in this field, still fighting to get equal pay and be treated fairly, so why is she making it so much harder for us all by not dressing professionally and allowing herself to be talked about this way? 

Just last week we had a professional engineer come and talk to us in an info session. This woman is a trailblazer, had to fight her way to be in the field, dealt with so much sexism, and is wildly successful. My friend sat in the front row nodding and getting emotional with all of us, all while dressed the way she is. The woman giving the presentation looked so professional in her business clothes, my friend looked like an anime character. 

Afterwards my friend wanted to stay overtime to tell the speaker that her speech was inspiring and to ask for advice. I finally said that she should maybe at least put on a jacket or something to do so. My friend was confused, asked me what I meant and I said very straight forward that it was borderline inappropriate and disrespectful to speak to someone of higher authority while dressed the way she was. she was livid, called me a slut shamer, said that I was giving into societys standards. no, i'm not, i just hold myself to a professional standard and understand that the work we're doing now will lead the way for other female engineers to come. she cried and left and we haven't talked in a few days.

s0dgmj,"Dear all, my first post here... Long time lurker and I introduced the idea of cuckolding to my wife over a year ago.
Anyways, my wife never was a big fan of blowjobs, to the point that during our whole relationship (7 years) she did it only once for me (and not for very long, probably it was less than a minute). I didn't pressure her into doing that anymore since I know she's not comfortable doing that (I go down on her regularly).
So far she met with her bull twice (he is her boss from work), once in October and then December last year. They didn't have sex, but they definitely tried and were in bed together. We have a rule that she tells me everything what happened. So of course one of first thing she did on those two occasions was to blow him and 69'ed with him.
First of all it was very surprising to be that she did it... And of course I got jealous, feeling unwanted and not worthy of her blowjobs. I mean in 7 years I get barely 1 minute of BJ and this guy gets it basically instantly she gets in bed with him? Part of me finds it of course hot but it is hard dealing with angst and jealousy.
Do you have any ideas how to make it feel better? Should I request her to blow me each time she does it to him? Or maybe embrace this and accept that some things are reserved only for the bull? I still have kind of hard time to become fully submissive and I don't know if I can accept that other men gets more of her than me.

But typically across all social media and popular social discussion in general I‚Äôve noticed a lot of hatred and slander unfairly directed at men who don‚Äôt want to date women who live a promiscuous lifestyle. Typically these men are labeled as bitter, anti-women, and even sociopaths. Simply expressing not wanting to date someone because of a lifestyle choice that might not mesh well with who you are as a person is not hateful at all. You also need to take into account promiscuous behavior is a trait commonly found in emotionally unstable people and as humans, we are built to look for emotional stability in a partner. For example, nobody would want to date someone who spends all their money on drugs or a severe alcoholic because of the baggage that will likely come with the relationship. There is nothing wrong with publicly expressing that and it should be the same way for all lifestyle preferences.  However, this does not mean going up to a promiscuous woman and saying something like ‚Äúif you were an animal you would be a whorse‚Äù . Because this comment is rude and disrespectful this post is not advocating for attacking anyone for a lifestyle choice it is saying that you can‚Äôt attack a man for having a preference.","There is nothing sexist, misogynistic or even rude about a man not wanting to date a promiscuous woman.",2.0,2.0

s6496k,"I joined late as an engineer for a Haz 4 Industrial Sabotage in Magma Core. There were already a scout, driller, and gunner at work on a powerstation. I start looking for nitra, only for driller or gunner to hit the button without asking. During this I am set on fire by driller and go down. 

We go for the second powerstation and get it connected, and scout and I go looking for nitra, only for one of the two others to hit the button again. After barely scrapping out a win against a horde that included a Bulk Detonator spawning on top of us, the Caretaker can be attacked.

 I start searching for nitra (again), only for those two to rush to the boss and start the fight without saying anything. What followed was one of the most harrowing battles I have seen in my 75 hours of playing this game. We were getting hammered by tentacles and half the arena was on fire, none of which was helped by all of us being low on ammo because someone used most of our nitra earlier. I shredded probably 15 sniper turrets, and at one point 3 of us were down and scout clutched it at the last second. 

At the end, we were all mostly out of ammo and low on health, but we stood victorious. We had the data rack and were about to call the drop pod. And then what happens? The driller murders me and the scout with a C4, followed by him and the gunner running for the drop pod. When we asked if they were serious,  the gunner responded ""You guys were a burden"" and take the pod out of the mission. Upon arriving at the hub, me and the scout are immediately kicked after the driller takes a second to mock us.

For the most part the community of this game is great, but just like any it has its assholes.

I don't just mean in terms of Technique, Ichika's blending of Genre and overall mind blowing playing clearly beats out a player like Eric clapton.

s07uk4,"Today, I experienced what I consider my worst shift working at Starbucks, and working with the public in general. In the last two years, it seems that Karen's are increasing in number and in severity. 

Daily, we endure verbal, emotional, and sometimes physical abuse at the hands of our customers. People regularly yell at us, the underpaid employees over things out of our control. 

List of things I, or my coworkers, were yelled at for today:

1) For not having someone's order rang in when they got to the drive through window. This person did not wait for me to greet them at the speaker box, but instead barked their order at me and sped down the drive thru lane while I was helping another guest. 

2) For not leaving the building and walking to this woman's car to take her order in the drive thru lane when she refused to roll down her window at the speaker box to order. 

3) For not taking a man's order when he tried to come in through the drive through the wrong way. He proceeded to get out of his car to order at the box. For safety reasons, we cannot permit this. He told us he would order at the window, which we also try to avoid, especially when there is a line wrapped around the building like today. He swore at us and circled the building for several minutes before leaving. 

4) For not modifying drinks for free. A woman called asking how to ring in a vanilla bean Frappuccino with an added scoop of matcha on the mobile app. We explained a few different ways to ring it in on the app. She calls back a few minutes later saying it's not working. We offered to have her come into the store and we can ring it in for her. She asked if she was going to be charged for the modification. She screamed so loud over the phone, I could hear her from several feet away.


I'm just so tired. I get up at 3:45am most mornings just to get shit on every single day. My coworkers and manager(s) are fantastic and I otherwise love this job but these CRUSTOMERS are driving me to insanity. 

Also please don't come to starbucks if you're sick. The medicine ball is not going to help you feel better than any normal tea. You can buy the ingredients for it at your local store. I'm tired of being coughed on by antimaskers 

Inb4: please don't tell me to quit. I just graduated college and am looking for jobs in my field.

So before asking him anything, I decided to jump to the worst possible conclusion so that if he *was* cheating on me, I'd have proof.

Now he has a mac and an iPhone, so his safari history syncs across devices. His computer was open, so I went into his browsing history, and I found his OnlyFans. Turns out he's a creator with a fair amount of subscribers. The shitty thing is that it wasn't just solo stuff -- he was legit out here fucking other dudes. I understand some, if not most, people do it purely for money, but I'm pissed because 1. He didn't tell me and 2. He's quite well off. He's a store manager at a local Walgreens living debt free in a rent controlled studio apartment. He's not even paying for cable and for streaming services he leeches off his friends! The only streaming service he pays for is Apple Music.

Still, I told myself ""it's just work, this means nothing to him, he just didn't tell you because he didn't wanna freak you out!""

So I opened up iMessages. Sexting. Several conversations with it, including one particularly gross chat where they were rp'ing with some absolutely disgusting shit.

Because I'm apparently a masochist, I decide to look through his phone. He doesn't know this but I once managed to sneak a peek at his passcode and so in I went. He didn't have any app on his home screen or a folder, and I guess he did the thing where certain apps won't show up through Siri or when you search for them... but there's one place you can't hide them: settings. He had notifications off for Grindr, Growlr, and Scruff. 

I opened up Grindr just to check it out and what do I find? Plans to fuck during his lunch break from work. 

I'm bad at confrontation so I'm not sure how I'm gonna bring this up, but I guess I'll have to do it eventually.

s1n3u2,"I (17f) am the oldest of seven siblings aged 15, 12, 9 (twins) and 3 (twins). My mom (45) is stay at home mom while my dad (48) is a doctor. 

Mom came to me yesterday and asked (told) if I‚Äôd watch my siblings on Saturday. I told her no because I‚Äôve got work in the morning, hanging with friends in the afternoon, and homework in the evening. She said I could forgo spending time with my friends and she then decided to tell me I was lying about homework. I told her no. This is the first time in three months I‚Äôve had the opportunity because we‚Äôve always had schedule problems. 

As far as homework there is always homework on the weekends in my AP classes. For reference I am currently taking
- AP English 4
- AP calculus AB
- AP statistics 
- AP macroeconomics
- AP biology
- forensic science
- AP Spanish 4
- drawing 4

I also work three days a week. Thursday and Friday from 6pm to 11pm and Saturday I work 7am to 3pm. I also am maintaining an A average in every class. 

Mom then said I was exaggerating and then called me a spoiled brat if I can‚Äôt even be nice and watch them for a few hours so she can go do something in peace. 

I told her that it wasn‚Äôt my fault she couldn‚Äôt keep her legs shut and that I wasn‚Äôt gonna watch them anymore. They are not my responsibility. 

She left the room and hasn‚Äôt talked to me since. Got a text from my dad that I need to apologize right now. It‚Äôs causing me to rethink stuff a bit. Was I an ass?

Edit. Forgot to add in that the 9 year olds are twins too. 

Also will be apologizing to my mom for essentially calling her a slut. You guys made a valid point about that.

Edit to update

Apologized to mom. Here is how it went

Me: I‚Äôm sorry about what I said about you. It was wrong and majorly harsh. 

Mom: if you really want to apologize you will babysit Saturday

Me: no but I can do Sunday. 

Mom; just go to your room. That‚Äôs not a real apology anyway.

s9br41,"I had gone out drinking and was in the mood to taunt and bait lol. It‚Äôs been something I‚Äôve been getting more and more into. Something about baiting men into wanting me and then pulling away, making them mad and still letting them have their way. Lmao

Basically the night went where I purposely dressed like a slut because I wanted attention. I ended flirting with a guy at a bar. We talked about kinks and shit. Told him I loved being followed and snuck up on etc etc. also told him I had a thing for married men. I let him kinda grope me in the bar a little but basically told him I needed to go home. He was basically turned on at that point and begged me to stay/go home with him. I told him no and that I needed to go home. I thought it would be fun to tease him more so I kissed him and made sure my hand has rested near his crotch when I leaned in. 

He took the bait. I knew he was following because he sucked at it LMAO. When I got behind my apartments he pushed me into the wall and told me he was gonna give it to me. His cock pressed up my skirt through his pants.

I was soaked. He pulled my top up and I felt my breast touch the cold brick walls. He immediately went for my ass with his hands. He was honestly kind of rough with the groping but that was ok. You could tell he hadn‚Äôt done this before but also could tell his natural instincts were kicking in. 

He started to finger me while he had me pressed against the wall. at some point he had pulled his pants down and his cock was just hanging there hard against my leg. he didnt wait long to start fucking me.

he basically used me as his first pussy that he could do what ever with. my tits kept smacking the brick wall while he fucked me hard and fast.

To be fair, he was invited to this birthday as it was a mutual friend of ours and said friend let me know ahead of time that he was invited, to which I was ok with. The part where I messed up was that when I initially did not see him I assumed he wasn't going to show and let my guard down and started drinking with everyone else. My ex showed up nearly 4 hours late and I was pretty far gone.   


To make a long story short at the end of the night he offered me a ride home. which I initially rejected knowing it was going to be some BS he was trying to pull. But he got me to agree and the next thing I know I was making out with him and later... you get the point. 

Also, side note I don't feel like I was raped or assaulted. I just feel angry that I let it happen and it isn't the first time. He seems to wait until I'm in a vulnerable position and pounces. Can anyone relate? If so, what did you do to change it?",Feeling Used Angry and Stupid.,2.0,2.0

I had considered it to be somewhat of a feature of the city's pub scene, but lately the food has been poor, manager has been moody and nasty to his staff (in front of customers), the atmosphere is gone and I've heard of others having similar experiences or saying things about the price and quality of the drinks at times but I must say I haven't experienced the drinks quality issue personally. It must be under new management or something as its not the place I remember for sure.

My wife went out with work friends tonight. I knew she would be back late but stayed up anyway just in case she needed to be picked up or whatever. Well she rolled in about 1:30 drunk af. I promptly turn off the movie I‚Äôm watching and we head to bed. I barely have time to get undressed before she says goodnight and rolls over. Now this struck me as odd because this woman gets RIDICULOUSLY horny when she been drinking. But I guess not tonight. Rather frustrated I climb into bed and try to write it off as her just being over tired and over served. Well I‚Äôm just about asleep when her phone loudly goes off startling me back into consciousness. Seeing no reaction from her, and knowing her notification will go off at least one more time unless it is dealt with, I reach over and grab it to flip the silent mode button. And here‚Äôs where shit gets fucked up. You see the notification was triggered by a text. A text from a guy who picked her up tonight, from some other random guys house bc random guy was super drunk and she was scared. His text, ‚ÄúGoodnight darling.‚Äù 

What followed was me doing what I‚Äôve never done, but obviously should have, a deep dive into her phone activity. What I found is as follows: she‚Äôs fucked at least one of my, now former, friends. She is involved in an emotional affair with a friend of hers from college (also married) who seemed VERY eager to take advantage of his wife‚Äôs absence so that he could spend time with mine (He was the noble knight who rescued her from rando drunk guy) And she has an impressively active tinder profile. Oh yeah and at one point this evening it seems she briefly considered hitching a ride with a stranger to Colorado. The texts, snaps and dms took about an hour to get through. 

So now I‚Äôm sitting here, house quiet, nauseous and internally raging, drinking cheap beer, trying to figure out how we got here. I‚Äôd wake her up to confront her, but the kids are asleep and I just don‚Äôt have the energy to fight tonight. There‚Äôs 6 years down the fuckin drain bois.

TL;DR - Found out my wife‚Äôs been fucking other dudes when I tried to silence her notifications.

Edit: Just wanted to say thank you to everyone for the kind words of support and mostly sound advise. Y‚Äôall are the best.

Update: Since I‚Äôve been asked a few times I‚Äôll try it on this thread. Idk if anyone will see if since it was taken down but oh well. I confronted her Sunday night. Eventually she admitted what I already knew. I assume there‚Äôs more I don‚Äôt know about. I got set up to start counseling next week.

s7e13e,"I honestly think one of the worst problems for men right now is sites like this. They go online and hear that only 20 percent of men get 80 percent of woman, or they see images of hot Instagram guys and start to believe they're ugly. From what I've seen in life most guys aren't lonely. The ones that are generally spend all their time on sites like this, and don't try to improve themselves. 

Even the most unappealing people you could imagine, I've seen with spouses. It's not impossible, it's normal. When you have men going online like this they fall into self pity and low self esteem and it drives them insane. For awhile I thought I was ugly and doomed to be alone but then I realized I wasn't. It was just low self esteem and obsession caused by reading all this stuff on reddit. Now I'm more confident and I'm gonna try socializing more and experiencing life. And the truth is most so called ""forever"" alone guys wouldn't even be alone if they didn't spend all their time obsesseing about how unfair life is. Chances are they're probably average and just fell into believing some bs propaganda, and they got to the point where it drove them to be an unlikable weirdo.


Also it's not like you can't put in the effort to become better looking. You can literally lose weight, get facial surgery, teeth whitened, go to the gym. These are are all possibilities you can go through if you really want to be better and get more dates. I saw this one guy's blog and he looked extremely ugly, then he put in the work and effort and he was getting dates with over a hundred people. If you're average it's extremely likely you can get above average if you actually put in the work. I mean woman put in tons of effort with make-up and shit, you actually think half of them are that naturally attractive? No, they're average. But apparently none of you guys wanna put in any effort at all. 

And also when it comes to this subreddit I think it's terrible advice to tell people to have sex with someone you're not attracted to. Only have sex if you are both mutually attracted, doing something you don't want for the sake of it won't make you feel better. 

Honestly most people on this subreddit need to get off the internet, stop obsessing about online theories about the amount of pussy guys get, and actually socialize. 

The world of men getting laid isn't as depressing as you lay it out to be, it's only depressing because you're part of a circle jerk.

A person was interested in the item, I took additional pictures at her request, answered all her questions, and she wanted me to hold it for a few days. I told her I'd only hold it if she paid in advance.  
 She Venmoed me the $ ($15 - large toy, but not large value)
The day she was supposed to come pick it up, she sent me a message saying she doing one she liker better, and wanted a refund.  I told her I have people pre-pay for situations exactly like that, and that I don't do refunds.  The toy would be ready for her to come pick up, as discussed (I suggested she can re-sell it.  I had other people interest in it, I just didn't want to go through the hassle of finding them and setting up new meet up times)
She called me a lot of names, and threatened to call the police.
I told her once again, the toy was waiting on my porch for pick up.  
I never heard from her again. Eventually I did re-sell it for less $ because I just wanted it gone.

Now what is so special about numbers asensio. Well when the card released he was already a good dribbler but now with 96 dribbling, he's the only player in the game with 99 ball control. He als has 87 balance, 93 agility, 90 reactions and 97 specific dribbling stat.

For a tallish player this makes him extremely strong on the ball, his first touch is one of the best I've seen in the game and I can just dribble a whole defense with left stick dribbling only.

His passing is ok ish but even with only 80 finishing, if you slap a hunter card on him he has 94 shot power and 90 finishing, this while he has 95 composure. He's also a lefty and I like my left striker to be a lefty, or 5 star wf at least. He also has a crazy finesse shot, and I can even put him in a cam position. 

This card costed me 50k, and I can't replace him. Not even with icons that cost a million coins;

adiya the snuff scout lusts after her mom 

*

'ungh, yes carrie fuck me just like that! harder!' the 18 year old adiya screamed, her pigtails flying as the sexy young girl scout bent over for her best friend carrie's 18 year old cock. 'god yes carrie deep just like that nice and FUCKING hard give it to me oh fuck i'm gonna cuuummm!!!! AAAH!!!'

'god adiya,' grinned the redheaded teen as she plowed the sexy young indian girl, adiya's skirt flipped up over her thick brown ass, the 18 year old girl scout moaning as she came all over the younger girl's dick. 'getting into the snuff bait brigade really turned you on, huh?'

'god yes,' moaned adiya as she turned back to kiss carrie. 'god I haven't been able to stop thinking about dying for the last 24 hours...'

the two friends were fucking in the little tent the girl scouts used to take breaks, while outside their fellow scouts were offering their lives to anyone who passed by.

'I can't stop thinking about how i'm not gonna survive the next 24 hours, fuck, the next 24 minutes,' moaned adiya, fucking herself on the redhead's softening cock. 'how i'm nothing more than rape meat for anyone who wants me. nothing more than a pretty young snuff doll who's going to be killed for some random stranger's sexual pleasure then tossed aside and turned into hamburger meat, ground up into mince by my own fellow scouts... god carrie i'm getting close again just thinking about it...'

a scream came from outside as one of their fellow girl scouts was violently snuffed. 'OH FUCK YES FUCKING DO IT YOU FUCKING COCKSUCKING BITCH SNUFF MEEE- AAAAAAIIIEE-UGHK!'

carrie grinned. that was julie. the sexy little brunette had just been fucked nice and good by a sexually frustrated mother of three before being thrown off the gallows and her neck snapped by the fall. carrie shuddered as she imagined the older woman's cum flowing down julie's dead thighs as her shapely little feet dangled and danced in her girl scout shoes, the dead 18 year old's piss flowing into her cute white socks.

'unnghh fuuuck,' adiya moaned as she came again from hearing julie's death screams. 'okay. that's it. i'm going out there right now. whoever's first in line for the snuff brigade is gonna end my pathetic little life.'

'any regrets?' carried grinned as she watched adiya pull up her panties and smooth down her sexy little girl scout skirt.

'not really,' adiya said. 'well... okay, fine, i'd love to have...'

'well, spill!' carrie said as she buttoned up her own uniform over her tiny tits, pulling her red hair out of her shirt. 'you can't just say that and not finish!'

'okay fine,' adiya groaned. 'it's embarrassing, promise you can't tell anyone.'

'my lips are sealed,' carrie grinned as she put on her JUNIOR FLUFFER CADETTE sash. 'mostly from being coated in older women's cum, but...'

'whore,' grinned adiya. 'okay fine. I just wish I could... I really wanted to know what it would be like to fuck my mom.'

carrie moaned. 'oh my god, same. your mom is so fucking hot. if she wanted I would get on my knees for her in a second.'

'fuck you, you can't fuck my mom!' adiya laughed. 'not before me anyway!'

'watch me,' carrie grinned, grabbing adiya's ass. 'after you're snuff meat i'll go over to your house and fuck your mom six ways from sunday. i'm gonna give her the best teenie fuck of her entire life and suck the cum out of her sexy brown milf cock until she sees stars. i'll be the best piece of 18 year old ass your mom has ever had and there's. nothing. you can. do about it.'

'fuck you,' moaned adiya, her hands reaching under carrie's skirt once again. 'seriously, fuck you carrie, that's so fucking hot you can't say shit like that...'

'maybe i'll bring her your severed head,' carrie whispered into adiya's ear and felt her best friend have a full body shudder as she came just from hearing that. 'impale your neck stump on that thick milf dick of hers and french kiss you while I suck your mom's cock through your fucking skull...'

'NNGH FUUUCK!' adiya screamed as she grabbed carrie's hips and shoved her 18 year old snatch right up against her best friend's cock. 'YES! TALK ABOUT HOW YOU'D USE MY CORPSE TO NECROFUCK MY MOM WITH! OH FUCK CARRIE YES I'M CUMMING!!'

'bring her your torn out ovaries and cook them for her then let her eat them out of my pussy...' moaned carrie, creaming in adiya's womb at the thought that her best friend's pussy that she was so passionately railing belonged to a girl that could soon be a red smear on the ground as a random woman beat her to death with a sledgehammer, or thrown under the steamroller and turned into paste. 'ungh! fuck!! adiya!!'

it was another few minutes before the two sexy little teenie scouts were tired out from their teenage fuck session, moaning into each other's hair as they kissed and wrapped their limbs around each other. 'oh i'm gonna miss fucking you adiya,' laughed carrie as the two kissed one last time and helped each other soak up the cum dripping down their thighs and smooth over their cute litle girl scout uniforms.

a shout came from outside. 'next snuff scout up please!'

'ok that's me,' adiya said, pecking carrie on the cheek. 'promise not to fuck my mom until like, two days after they eat me.'

'sure thing,' laughed carrie as adiya moved to the front of the snuff line. the two scouts could hear sexy little lisa who had just turned 18 a few short hours ago moaning and gasping as she was fucked  in all her tight little teenie holes by three older teens wearing varsity athlete uniforms

'YES! YES I'M CUMMING! GOD I'M GONNA DIE WITH CUM IN ALL MY VIRGIN HOLES!' lisa screamed right as the short-haired butch brunette who was fucking her sweet little virgin blonde pussy put the revolver to her temple. 'DO IT! lisa screamed as her sweet teenie tits jiggled under her. 'FUCKING DO IT! SNUFF MEEEEE-'

lisa's eyes went wide as the butch girl blew the 18 year old girl scout's brains out. she instantly went limp, the three college girls moaning as they necrofucked her still warm corpse.

carrie could see adiya shudder as she creamed her little white panties from watching the younger scout die. but still she put on a big smile and moved up to the front of the line.

'hi, miss, would you like to snuff me for charity- MOM!?!?'

'oh!' meera gasped, the older indian woman's jaw dropping as she saw who was the snuff scout she had just been assigned. 'adiya?!'

'no assignment changes,' the scout master said, winking at the mother and daughter before smacking the 18 year old teen on the butt with her clipboard. 'just hold hands if you want, but i'm not letting you off the hook, young lady. next snuff scout!'

'mom, what are you doing here?' adiya whispered as the scoutmaster pushed them towards the snuff pen. 'you're fucking scouts? you're snuffing scouts? you know i'm a scout, right?'

'I know, adiya,' meera said, pinching her nose. 'i'm so sorry you had to see me here, it's just... the truth is i've been so lonely since your mother died, and it's been a long time since...'

adiya arched an eyebrow. 'I mean, I know you jerk off to teenaged snuff porn every night...'

meera gasped. 'adiya!'

'it's true!' adiya said. 'maybe you shouldn't moan my name so loud when you watch those sexy little high schoolers getting railed and tortured to death by their teachers then I wouldn't have to touch myself listening to you stroke that thick, hard milf cock of yours into my dirty panties and imagine you painting my face with that sexy creamy girl cum instead of nutting in my underwear every night!'

carrie couldn't help but laugh. adiya's mom looked like she'd been electrocuted.

'a-a-a-a-adiya, I-'

'it's ok mom,' smiled adiya as she took her mother's hand and gently guided put it on her small, flat stomach. meera gasped with sudden lust as her own daughter guided meera's fingers past the waistband of her girl scout skirt and into her panties. the older woman gasped as she felt the heat of her own daughter's cunt lips gripping her fingertips. 'I know you've always lusted after me. I've thought about jerking you off into my cunt more times than I can count. I always wanted the courage to come downstairs, sit next to you on the couch, and take that thick sexy mommy cock into my sweet little teenie mouth or my tight sexy little virgin babypussy and watch your face as you paint my sweet insides with your creamy incest load while watching young girls my age getting raped to death... put a baby sister inside me so we could both have another snuff toy to play with... or put a knife in your hands and let you gut me from cunt to collarbone as my insides spilled out onto your thick milf titties...'

'oh fuck,' carrie moaned, her little 18 year old cock as hard as diamond in her panties as she listened to adiya say such filthy depraved things to her own mother

meera moaned with uncontrollable lust for her only child. 'adiya, I-'

her daughter kissed her on the lips. 'it's ok mommy. we can make up for lost time now. can't you feel how wet I am to get snuffed by my mommy? i'm glad it was you in the front of the line mommy. I want you to grab my pigtails and choke me on your cock until you drown me in your sperm. do you feel that, mommy? do you feel my girlcream dripping out from your hand? that's how wet I am thinking about losing my life to you, your only baby girl dying so sexily on her mommy's cock. that's where I belong mommy. dying on your meat. just a worthless little snuff whore for you to rape to death and scream with the best orgasm of your entire life as you fill my lungs with mommy juice!'

'FUCK!' meera screamed, shoving adiya to her knees and slamming her head against a nearby table. 'okay, fine. you want it so bad you little snuffwhore, you can get what you came here for... you wanted to volunteer for the snuff bait brigade? then you can fucking DIE for mommy!'

'MMMPH! MMMPPHHH!' adiya screamed, squirting cum from underneath her white panties so hard she splashed her own knees as her own mother began to throatfuck her to within an inch of her 18 year old life, meera screaming as she slammed her teenaged daughter's skull into the table with long, hard thrusts ‚Äì bam! bam! bam!

'oh fuck that's sooo hot,' moaned the girl next to carrie who was in the middle of tearing little melody's liver out from her cut open belly, the pale redheaded teenie girl scout moaning from having a massive orgasm as she was disemboweled while still alive. 'can you see that?'

'y-yes I can,' moaned melody as she reached into her own stomach and played with her guts. 'god the two of them are gonna make me cum...'

'not before I fuck your heart,' moaned the girl as she sat on the 18 year old melody's sliced open stomach and slid her cock between the dying girl scout's ribs...

carrie couldn't help herself, she was reaching into her skirt pocket and discreetly jerking herself off while watching meera slam adiya against the table. adiya's brown eyes were unfocused, her legs were jerking randomly... oh fuck, carrie thought, moaning as she came all over her hand, she could see her brains sliding down the back of her head... her own mother had bashed her fucking skull in...

'sorry miss meera,' moaned carrie as she knelt between meera's legs, spread the milf's thick, juicy ass cheeks and began to worship her asshole. 'I have to... I just have to taste your ass while you beat poor adiya's brain's out...

'yes service me,' moaned meera as she deathfucked her baby girl's throat while carrie ate her asshole, one hand gripping her daughter's pigtails while the other pushed her best friend deeper into her thick, curvy milf ass. 'oh god adiya... I have to confess sweetie... this wasn't a coincidence. when I heard you got into the snuff brigade... I knew i'd never forgive myself if I didn't take the chance to murder my own baby girl... my sweet little adiya choking on my cock... thinking about snuffing you made me so horny I couldn't think... so I bribed your scout master baby... I made sure that I would be the one to take your life, to die for me... oh FUCK baby your death gurgles feel so FUCKING good!! YES! DIE! FUCKING DIE FOR MOMMY YOU USELESS LITTLE WHORESLUT!' meera screamed as she throatraped her own daughter to death. 'TAKE MY CUM DOWN INTO YOUR LUNGS AND DROWN ON MY COCK! FUCK THIS FEELS EVEN BETTER THAN I DREAMED ABOUT! DIE! FUCKING DIE! DIE FOR MOMMY YOU DIRTY LITTLE SLUTBITCH!!' screamed meera as her daughter's face began to turn blue, her gorgeous brown eyes rolling up into her skull as she choked on her mother's cum and her brains spilled down the back of her neck. white spurts of mommy juice bubbled from young adiya's nose as she drowned in her own mother's milf cum while the scoutmaster who had sold adiya's life grinned as she too throatfucked another 18 year old junior fluffer cadette, her hand buried in the girl's blonde locks as she bounced her up and down on her cock.

'AAH YES!' meera screamed as adiya's arms began to spasm randomly as her brains were destroyed, her eyes darting in random directions as her mother's cum flowed down her lips and onto her thick teenaged tits. I'M MURDERING MY BABY GIRL WITH MY COCK! I'M DEATHRAPING MY ONLY CHILD! INCEST SNUFFING MY INNOCENT LITTLE 18 YEAR OLD GIRL SCOUT! GOD YES CARRIE GET THAT TONGUE DEEPER SO I CAN SHOOT MY CUM RIGHT INTO MY OWN DAUGHTER'S FUCKING GUTS!!'

'god I fucking needed that,' moaned meera as the dead adiya flopped to the ground, her girl scout  uniform rumpled and soaked with her own mother's cum, more jism dripping from her lips as her brains continued to leak from the back of her head.

'oh fuck,' carried moaned, a thick wet spot in her skirt as meera's juices dripped down her chin and stained her girl scout uniform, revealing the outline of her bra underneath. 'miss meera that was... that was...'

but meera wasn't done yet.

carrie screamed as adiya's mother pushed the remains of her daughter's dead skull up and down on the redheaded's scout's 18 year old cock, adiya's dead brown eyes staring up at carrie. so much of her head had been dashed against the table that carrie's teenie cock head was poking adiya's eyeball out from her skull, and carrie screamed with her second orgasm in two minutes as miss meera, who was using adiya's torn out womb as a cock sleeve, began eating adiya's dead eyeball off the redheaded girl scout's teenaged cock, moaning as she swallowed the delicious mix of teenie girl scout cream as well as her own dead daughter's eyeball and brains, as all around them dozens of other girls and women were touching themselves or fucking each other or snuffing another pretty young girl scout, inspired by the brutal, depraved teenage necro rape that was happening in front of them.

but carrie and meera were oblivious, meera's brown cock spurting inside her daughter's womb as she kissed adiya's best friend who was currently grabbing adiya's pigtails and screaming as she came inside her skull.

rzk66v,"I‚Äôm the main tank (prot warrior), the main raid leader, and one of the guild recruiters for my guild. We started in the beginning of P2 on small server with only about 12-14 core members and slowly worked our way to 10/10. Most of the 10+ people that have since joined our guild were from my friends list that I would constantly hit up to join our raids without the pressure of joining the guild, and a handful more I recruited off LFG and Discord. We now have a solid 25 man roster going into Phase 3.

We went from MS > OS /roll to now EPGP.

In all or P2 I main tanked all of the progression for 10/10 while constantly losing gear to our pally OT. He won the first Gruul shield and it took me months to just form pugs outside of the guild until I eventually got my own shield. 

Going into P3 I‚Äôm telling the GMs and that pally I expect the shield from Kazrogal to be prio‚Äôd to me or I‚Äôm stepping down as MT.

Mind you this is paladin tank who‚Äôs friends with the GM and is in the ‚Äúparse-adin‚Äù mentality, he dies on trash in SSC and TK even with all the gear he was won over me.

I told him I want him to pass the shield to me and he said in my dreams. 

I‚Äôm considering stepping down from MT and possibly even the guild if he rolls on it and wins. I‚Äôve helped build this guild from the ground up in a small server and ensured on-time attendance while recruiting missing roster spots and leading/preparing for/explaining fights.

The guild leadership does not want to do any prio/loot council due to implementing EPGP recently.

Am I being petty? The shield is all I want prio‚Äôd and I‚Äôm going to pass on T6 to rsham and hunter.

Edit #1: I suggested me prio for Kazrogal shield and him prio for Bulwark and his reply was ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want Bulwark.‚Äù I‚Äôm suggesting this being the main tank for progression and paladins taking over later in the phase.",Am I being petty/selfish about Phase 3?

kp18nw,"The YouTube channel 'Astro Soup Archive' is very likely owned and ran by 'Molecular MageXD'; the latter is utilising the ""sudden disappearance"" of Astro Soup to gain a profit off of Astro Soup's videos by re-uploading them with ads incorporated into them (ad revenue) and by sharing links to videos on his channel (which also have ads) as means of advertising his content.

Because of this, I believe that the appopriate course of action would be, at the least, to report this seemingly innocent ""archiving channel"" to YouTube for impersonation, given that none of the other reporting options available specifically apply to the ongoing situation.

The content on Astro Soup Archive has been already re-uploaded onto another YouTube channel, 'Astro Soup Fan Channel' (https://youtube.com/channel/UCCNvWdEzPqzZPFwI7H0zbaQ), which was shared on this subreddit a few days ago and it doesn't seem to be affiliated with Molecular MageXD in any way. In any case, this channel does not feature any kind of advertisement in its videos, which means that whoever its owner truly is, they are **NOT** making any profit off of Astro Soup's content, something that Astro Soup Archive ***is*** actively doing.

For anyone who doesn't know, Molecular MageXD is someone who posts GTA Online videos on YouTube who once had an in-game litigation with Astro Soup, all of which was covered on the latter's YouTube channel. For some reason, upon the disappearance of Astro Soup, this person decided it was appropriate to first impersonate Astro Soup by, initially, not featuring the word ""Archive"" into its channel name, and to then start sharing links to videos on his channel and adding ads to videos on Astro Soup Archive to advertise his own (Molecular MageXD's) content and profit off of the content originally produced and uploaded by Astro Soup.

Would you like someone taking shit you created with your hard work and skill, first advertise it as its own and then start to make a profit off of it? I certainly wouldn't, and I'm sure you wouldn't either. Because of this, let's make this stop.

P.S. For proof of my statements against Molecular MageXD (e.g. making a profit off of Astro Soup), take a look at these two links:
1. https://www.youtube.com/post/UgyQySW5swyb3xLkHCl4AaABCQ
2. https://www.youtube.com/post/Ugyw7kdXjsjGs6TBLOR4AaABCQ

Here, you will be able to see two posts made in the community tab of the 'Astro Soup Archive' channel. The two different links that are shared in the posts, if clicked, will bring you to a specific video on Molecular MageXD, which, obviously, has ads.

This is something that both shows how Molecular MageXD is profiting from ***AND*** advertising his own content through the Astro Soup Archive YouTube channel.

For more proof, have a look at the videos posted on the channel; you will see that most of them (if not all) have a small yellow mark on their timeline when you are watching them; this signifies the presence of an advertisement, which, as written above, equals to ad revenue for Molecular MageXD.

Now, finally, on to the important part:

To report the 'Astro Soup Archive' channel (https://youtube.com/channel/UCJ7TeCuwocaHpyxpTQ3v-PA), follow the steps below:

s47naw,"This has been bothering me for quite some time. I joined this subreddit because I really LOVED inside job and found it to be an amazing, humorous, and quirky show. As I remain in this subreddit, however, I become increasingly more uncomfortable with the way Reagan is viewed by the fan base. Reagan is a super cool character: she‚Äôs super smart, awkward, entertaining, and weirdly charismatic. She‚Äôs a total badass and I find it so cool to see such a strong female lead who‚Äôs surprisingly relatable‚Ä¶

Which is why it‚Äôs kind of frustrating when it seems like every post is people sexualizing her. I‚Äôm not saying that you can‚Äôt have cartoon crushes (I originally clicked on an Inside Job clip because I thought that Reagan was cute) but when every comment is just objectifying her and the ratio of sexualisation to legitimate character analysis is ridiculously skewed it gets upsetting. This is compounded by the fact that this community just cannot let this woman be a single, badass female lead. If she isn‚Äôt being sexualized, she‚Äôs being constantly shipped with Brett. Ships aren‚Äôt inherently bad, but I don‚Äôt understand why every remark about the two of them has to be about how they‚Äôre perfect together or NEED to be in a romantic relationship. I don‚Äôt think that Reagan needs a man to be powerful‚Äî that‚Äôs why she‚Äôs so appealing.

As a girl who wants to go into STEM, I absolutely love Reagan as a character and love all of the stereotypes that she defies. 

I‚Äôm not really sure what a solution to this would be because she is a cartoon character and this is the Internet. Ultimately,  there is just something terribly disheartening about watching a dynamic, well-thought out character be whittled down to nothing more than another sex object.",About Reagan‚Ä¶,2.0,2.0

Fuck ‚Äòem, fund us or catch your own cunts.

Instead, he‚Äôs making me wait, like he always does when it‚Äôs something unpleasant. I‚Äôm starting to wonder if word of that homeless cunt I left toothless is getting around, or if managed to piss off some vErY iMpOrTaNt PeRsOn, like a councilman‚Äôs bratty kid. Maybe they found that bottle of Laphroaig in my desk drawer. I fix my mustache, trying to sit still. Whatever it is, it‚Äôs bad news.

‚ÄúGood news, Cy!‚Äù erupts the Chief as he swings the door open excitedly. My face holds no expression as I follow him with my eyes to his desk. He sounds deflated: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt look excited.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood news my ass, Chief,‚Äù I say, annoyed. ‚ÄúJust lay it on me, I got shit to do today.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell *I* think it‚Äôs good news,‚Äù he says as though he‚Äôs trying to convince himself. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been assigned a big case; a *career-maker*.‚Äù He pulls a manila folder out his desk and happily extends his arm out to me. I take it and scan it while I finish getting the hairs above my lips back into place. 

‚ÄúFile says the victim‚Äôs fuckin‚Äô loaded, and I‚Äôm to be after his favorite piece of arm candy, huh? This doesn‚Äôt sound like anything for my career - that sounds like a big ol‚Äô donation to *your* station once I bring back‚Ä¶‚Äù I glance down at the file again to find the name. ‚Äú‚Ä¶ Sweet Cheeks here.‚Äù

‚ÄúLike I said, Cy, caree-‚Äú

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt call me ‚ÄòCy.‚Äô‚Äù

‚ÄúFine.‚Äù His eyes shift - I can tell his nerves are starting to grate, but he‚Äôs contained. He really wants this case solved. ‚ÄúLike I said, **Cyrus**, career-maker. No matter how **you** want to frame it.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, so it‚Äôs my good deed to the department. Great. Grand. Wonderful. But,‚Äù I lean forward and rest my elbows on my knees. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not telling me something. So the vic‚Äôs important. Why even tell me? This is shit I do every day. *Every day* I‚Äôm tracking down lost, stolen, or fleeing, **lying**, cheating, **dirty** cunts and hauling them back into the loving chains of some dolt who don‚Äôt know how to keep *one*.‚Äù I raise a single finger to punctuate the words.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs‚Ä¶ all in the file, Cy.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt fucking call me ‚ÄòCy,‚Äô‚Äù I retort through clenched teeth with a tone to match.

Conversation pauses, a sudden, screeching halt to silence as soon as I step over the line, but I‚Äôm tired of being jacked around in the worst possible way. He should be yelling right now for that, but he‚Äôs not. He doesn‚Äôt just want this thing closed, he *needs* this thing *to go away*.

Chief closes his eyes, exhales, and opens them again, fixing his face into a firm but honest expression. ‚ÄúCum Gulper has been assigned as your attachment.‚Äù

I bolt up from my chair, eyes shooting lightning. ‚ÄúFUCKING WHAT? CUM GULPER? THAT WALKING PROPAGANDA PIECE?‚Äù

Outside the office the white noise of keyboards keys clacking, carpet-padded footsteps, and gentle murmurs between adjacent desk-jockeys went silent.

‚ÄúIT‚ÄôS BULLSHIT TO BEGIN WITH! YOU‚ÄôVE ALL GONE AND JUST GAVE A MAN‚ÄôS JOB TO SOME FUCKING CUNT? COPS ARE GONNA **DIE**, ***BOB***.‚Äù

Chief seems unaffected at this point. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs coming down from pretty high up.‚Äù

‚ÄúSHE CANT DO IT. SHE CANT DO THE JOB! I BET SHE CANT EVEN FIRE A GUN! HOW CAN SHE RUN WITH THOSE THINGS! IN THOSE THINGS!‚Äù

Chief folds his hands, silent. I grimace, turn and leave, grumbling as I go.

I‚Äôd heard all the rumors and seen a few interviews with this got-damn experiment, this shit-show clusterfuck of a carnival act. Even seen her around the station on occasion, obviously being paraded around for the sake of morale, a goddamn cop mascot. To wit: Ain‚Äôt impressed. Give a cunt tasks meant for men, and watch her fail. Maybe not on my time, but one day she will, and hard.

Moments later I‚Äôm at the the doors to the armory, one large rookie standing before it. I flash my badge. ‚ÄúGet me..‚Äù I strain against the words, hard as they are to say. ‚ÄúThe Cunt. Cop.‚Äù The last consonant pops off my lips.

‚ÄúAight,‚Äù  he says as if he‚Äôs bored. ‚ÄúCome with. She in the way back.‚Äù I follow the man in. Cameras attached to SMG‚Äôs whir until pointed at us. We hold our badges high, thumbs clear of our own photos upon them.

Through another set of heavy steel doors, then another, until, after a long hallway, we arrive a solitary pink door in the style of an upper middle class home. The guard opens it.

There she is, behind a cage that cuts the small room in half. She sits atop a saddle of sorts, sets of thick black belts winched tight to keep her legs locked in the fashion most useful to men. Her arms are similarly denied any range of motion, and sit behind her back at neat right angle, forcing her back to arch, exposing the shape of the musculature under her skin, and presenting her breasts, their teardrop shapes heaving slightly under her constant physical duress. The barely audible and intermittent *bzzz* seems to stem from the saddle.

Past the ring gag that keeps her mouth agape comes steady but audible breathing. A drop of drool spills out of her mouth and onto her tits, which I now see is starting to collect several small strands.

She stares ahead at a screen encased in glass. Across it flash images: a woman‚Äôs asshole duct-taped open and a wine bottle being forced inside of it; a pair of smiling, made-up lips, expression quickly turning to a frown as a hard cock is placed against its nose, ejaculating up its nostrils; of a cunt doubling over as a man‚Äôs fist makes contact with her stomach, then falling as he lands another on her chin. The room is silent. The CuntCop is wearing headphones.

When I saw her around the office, they had her dress like a damn stripper. Here it was different. Here, her flesh was laid entirely bare all choice removed from the matter. Here, she was kept in a way you might keep a soup on simmer, ready to serve at a moment‚Äôs notice. Here, she was constantly being reminded of what will happen if she steps out of line while keep in perpetual arousal. It‚Äôs beautiful. She‚Äôs beautiful.

‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt this all a bit much?‚Äù I ask as much to myself as I do the guard.

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù Replies the guard. He doesn‚Äôt sound bored anymore. ‚ÄúStay on this side, Detective,‚Äù he commands as he unlocks the cage, the bindings, and the gag, one by one, then finally removes her earpiece. She remains on the saddle, staring ahead.

For a moment I‚Äôm at a loss for words before I remember myself. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get one thing clear, and I mean *crystal* clear, right now. I don‚Äôt like you. I don‚Äôt care if you fuck-in *die*, so keep up, don‚Äôt become a liability, and don‚Äôt even think about crossing me, or I‚Äôll put your corpse down a mineshaft and lead the rescue effort.

‚ÄúNow that‚Äôs outta the way, tell me what the fuck you‚Äôre good for.‚Äù

Maybe I shouldn't be surprised, but I am. I can't believe she said that. So I'm not my own person?

rvkdkd,"
So my gf (20) and I (20) have been dating for almost 2 and a half years now. To make things clear, call me Miguel and lets call her Lia (not our real names). For a bit of background, we‚Äôve been dating since the start of college when there was still f2f classes. Because of certain circumstances (that being none of us drive), we‚Äôve been ldr since the pandemic but occasionally try to meet each other every 2 months at her place (Her parents are strict so its me who goes there).

So before i explain how i caught her cheating and my current dilemma, let me give you a brief background of Her past relationships. She had said to me in the past that she cheated on her exes before. The first ex, she said she cheated on him because he was toxic and did it for revenge and the second ex, her reason was a very drunken one night stand.
I accept her of course because i genuinely felt she grew from those experiences but was still scared that maybe she would cheat on me too. She reassured me time and time again during f2f classes that she isn‚Äôt like that anymore.

However, i started noticing some suspicious behavior from her when we became LDR. For one, everytime i would visit her place, she never allows me to touch her phone anymore. She just uses the excuse it‚Äôs charging upstairs or just doesn‚Äôt let go of it as well as prefers to use my phone to take pictures of us. Second, she disappears for quite some time during the morning and late at night and usually tells us to sleep early like around 10pm even tho she‚Äôs awake till 3am. Another would be that i would randomly see ‚Äúdeleted message‚Äù in our conversation in messenger and she just goes wrong send. Lastly, we became less intimate in terms of sex. To be specific, she‚Äôs not into momol, bjs and other acts with me anymore as compared to before. She sometimes even says she‚Äôs just tired.

Despite all my suspicions, i just didn‚Äôt mind it too much since generally Lia is a busy person. For one, she‚Äôs part of so many orgs in school plus is working and has a not so good relationship with her parents. So i definitely understand why she would want a lot of space and time on her own. 

But still, i still wanted to confront her about this issue. So when we were in a vidcall around last year march,  i opened the topic regarding cheating and she was freaking pissed with me for even opening it up. For one she went ‚Äúdont you trust me‚Äù and went ‚Äúwhy would you accuse me‚Äù. By the end,we didn‚Äôt talk for at least a week and she just kept crying on the video call. I eventually apologized and never brought up this topic ever again. However i still felt like she was hiding something from me.

So fast forward a bit to late October 2021, this was the day were we finally came out to her parents that we were dating (just know her parents are old fashioned and i had to prove myself a lot of times for them). It was basically a dinner date with her parents and us. Things went smoothly enough and i got there approval which made it such a happy day for us. 

So, im telling you this because midway through the dinner date, her phone died out so she used my phone. To elaborate, her parents went to pick up the car while she and I waited outside for them. So she used my phone to talk to them on messenger. Now when she got picked up, she didnt log out of her messenger on my phone so her account was just there in the switch account section of messenger.

Why is this important you may ask? Well a few weeks later around the middle of November. Lia and I got into a fight which ended up with us not talking for quite a few days but i got the feeling something was wrong. The fight was petty and out of nowhere.

So... one late night, i decided to open her messenger account out of sheer desperation and curiosity to figure out whats going on with her. I know what i did was wrong but what i found out was worse. She was FUCKING CHEATING on me and used the fight as an excuse to have sex with one of her fubus. YES you read that right fubus. NOT ONE, NOT TWO BUT FIVE. I WAS FUCKING CRYING AND BROKEN WHEN I OPENED HER ACCOUNT. 

I of course did a bit more digging to who these five people are and well fuck... 3 of them I know... they are batchmates of ours in school. I recognized them because they‚Äôre part of the same org as her. WANNA KNOW WHAT‚ÄôS WORSE? SHE‚ÄôS IN A GC WITH ALL THREE OF THEM. WHAT‚ÄôS IN THE GC YOU MAY ASK? SEX VIDS OF HER AND THE THREE OF THEM AND THEIR NUDES. TANGINA, when i opened her account the group was active, they were fucking sharing their nudes pa.... i legit walked in on them doing this shit üòì

The worst part of this... they were already having sex apprently even during f2f classes. She was literally fucking people behind my back when we started dating like wtf.... I dont even wanna mention how bad it was backreading this fucking gc, i felt so degraded.... and disgusted... 

The other two fubus naman, from what i was able to check from their chat history, one was a guy she met on bumble... YES SHE FUCKING HAS A BUMBLE TOO,,,, like TANGINA... LIKE HOW EVEN??? the other guy naman, it seems like they dont chat much on messenger, more so on tg eh pero tangina pa rin!!

Of course... i wanted to confront her about this and break up... but things got more fucking complicated. A few days after me discovering this garbage, they found out they were positive for Covid... her entire family.... and well things didnt go well. Her grandmother died so all of them were griefing and well... i cant just break up with her especially after what happened... and her mental disorder so like ive been keeping all this inside me and its tearing me apart as it is. 

Around December, her parents wanted me to come cause it would make her happy but fuck it was awkward knowing the circumstance im in... i pretended to be okay but fuck, she was still chatting them despite all of these. LITERALLY WHILE SHE WAS GRIEFING, she kept sending nudes and vidcalling with them like fuck man.... 

Well... now its January and i still haven‚Äôt confronted her about this... as a matter of fact i don‚Äôt even know how to... i just lurk here but i really need help, i cant ask my friends cause well they‚Äôre our friends too so its just gonna be much more disastrous so honestly i need help,,, how do i confront her without her hurting more after her personal loss...

Edit: i just wanna get this out of my chest and fucking rant rin pero tangina, during our second anniversary... she said she couldn‚Äôt come cause she had a fever. The truth was she wasnt even sick at all, she legit already had plans on that day with them... turns out lang she just forgot same day yung anniversary namin tas yung session nila like tangina.... i even made her a video tribute for our anniversary but she was just inactive most of the morning and afternoon, sabi tulog pero based on the chat history, they were just fucking TANGINA.... üòì",I caught my girlfriend cheating on me,1.0,2.0
rwut94,,Comment 'I am a good slut' if you're gooning like this,,
rp541f,"TL;DR at bottom.

&nbsp;

Let me start off by saying that this did not happen to me, but rather to a cousin of mine who is 18 and a senior in high school. She told me the story and gave me permission to share it.

So my cousin has a natural patch of white hair at the front of her otherwise dark head of hair. She's had this all her life and it's gotten bigger as she's gotten older. She used to get teased a lot for it at school...until bleaching/dyeing the hair at the front of your head a different color than the rest of your hair became a trend, and now she blends right in with other girls her age. (I believe that this is the ""E-girl"" look. If you google it you'll see which hairstyle I'm referring to. My cousin's hair looks similar to this, only she doesn't have to dye her hair to get the light streak.)

The school she currently attends has a very strict dress code that includes no hair that is dyed ""unnatural colors"" and extreme hairstyles, and frowns heavily on dyed hair in general. When in-person classes resumed at her school, one of my cousin's teachers took one look at her hair and sent her to the principal's office, insisting my cousin's ""unnatural, extreme"" hair was in violation of the dress code and ""too distracting"", despite the fact that she's never dyed/bleached any part of her hair in her life. My cousin insisted that this is the way her hair has always grown, but the principal was having none of it. She told my cousin ""When you come back tomorrow, I expect you to have dyed your hair back to its natural color, and don't dye it again! As long as you are at our school, you are to adhere to the dress code!"" My cousin smugly replied with ""Of course, I will comply with the dress code from now on!""

My cousin got some hair dye that was as close of a match to the hair on the rest of her head as possible. In order for it to blend in, she ended up dyeing all of her hair, not just the white streak. The next day when she walked in, the teacher complimented her on her ""natural"" hair and told her never to dye her hair again.

Cue malicious compliance!

As with anyone who dyes their hair, the roots eventually need to be touched up as the hair grows. But my cousin didn't bother with doing that. At first nobody (at least none of the teachers/staff) batted an eyelid. It wasn't until her hair had grown maybe an inch or so that her teacher suddenly looked at her and barked ""What did we tell you about your hair? No unnatural colors or extreme hairstyles! We told you to dye it back to its natural color and not dye it again! Go to the principal's office!""

My cousin did as she was told. The principal asked her why her hair looked the way it did. My cousin replied with ""Well, you told me to dye my hair back to its 'natural' color and to never dye it again! So I did just that. I dyed my hair the color of the hair on most of my head to get rid of the white streak, which, by the way, is how my hair naturally grows, and didn't dye it again, so now the roots are showing! I did exactly what you told me to do!""

The principal called her parents and told them to come pick their daughter up, explaining that due to her multiple violations of the school's dress code, she would be suspended. So they came to the school and brought the family photo album with them, which had pictures of my cousin at various stages of her life, all with the white patch in her hair. In addition, her father also has a white patch of hair on the front of his otherwise dark head of hair. It runs on his side of his family (I believe the medical term for it is ""poliosis""). So the principal reluctantly didn't end up suspending my cousin, but she did give her a warning that ""Your extreme hair is still a distraction to the other students, and they are going to wonder why you're getting special treatment. Consider yourself lucky!""

So my cousin wasn't suspended and didn't get any more harassment from the school staff. Gradually her hair returned to its natural ""extreme"" color. She still continues to occasionally get disapproving looks from the school staff, but none of her classmates feel like she's getting special treatment, and think it's cool that her hair naturally grows that way.

My cousin says that she will not be returning to that school next semester and will be home-schooled instead.

&nbsp;

Edit 1: Wow, I did not expect this post to blow up the way it did. Thank you all for the awards and upvotes!

I would like to clarify some stuff people were asking about. Yes, my cousin and I are both American, but from different states. The school my cousin attended was indeed a private Christian school. She told me that their dress code was very strict, but for some things they were stricter with girls about, and for other things they were stricter with boys. Girls could grow their hair as long as they wanted to provided it was clean, well kept, and not styled in an extreme way. Boys were required to have their be short enough to not touch the back of their collar or their eyebrow, and must style it in a ""conservative"" way. Hair on both boys and girl must be its natural color and not dyed. Boys also were required to shave their faces daily, even if they only had peach fuzz. Girls were allowed to wear earrings provided they weren't too large (or distracting), boys weren't allowed to wear any jewelry at all. There of course was the usual ""skirts must be a certain length, no spaghetti straps"" etc. Hats, hoods, sunglasses, and jackets were only to be worn outdoors. Students' clothes were not to have any logos or images on them with the exception of the school emblem, and they were not allowed to wear anything that was considered ""faddish"".

She told me about this one guy who wore the type of glasses that get darker when you go outside, and his teacher mistook them for sunglasses and made him take them off. Since they were prescription lenses, he was unable to see everything clearly unless he wore the glasses. His parents complained but the school insisted that the glasses took too long to return to their clear state and would be too distracting, both for him and the other students. So his parents were forced to buy him two new pairs of prescription glasses; a pair of regular glasses and a pair of sunglasses.

I think some of these rules were relaxed a bit for the Zoom sessions, but once in-person classes resumed they started cracking down on students who were violating the dress code.

&nbsp;

Edit 2: [Here's a picture of a girl with a similar hairstyle to my cousin's.](https://i2.wp.com/rodankersalons.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/img_1415.jpg?resize=564%2C564&ssl=1) The girl in the picture obviously dyes her hair as you can see the roots. My cousin wears her hair in a similar way but the hair at the front is even lighter and never needs the roots touched up, because it's her natural color. 

&nbsp;

Edit 3: Once again, I want to thank all of you for the upvotes, awards, and feedback. A lot of you have given great suggestions as to what my cousin's family should do. They have made their intentions quite clear that they do not wish to pursue any legal action against the school. Like I've already said, my cousin has decided to finish the remaining months of her senior year being homeschooled. This was her decision. She wants to concentrate on her finals and preparing for college without any distractions.

I'd like to clear up a few more things that people have been asking about. The first one is that, no, the girl in the picture I posted is NOT my cousin. For privacy purposes my cousin doesn't want me to share any photos of her. But I wanted to show you all the hairstyle ""fad"" that the school insisted my cousin was following even though (up until they asked her to) she had never dyed her hair. So I went on Google Images to try and find some examples of how my cousin wears her hair, and how it could potentially be mistaken for money pieces, the Rogue look, or whatever you want to call it. My cousin's hair is all natural, and it just so happens that she currently blends in with a lot of girls in her age group, which is cool because when she was younger she used to get teased for having ""old lady"" hair because it's so white in the front.

That being said, now that she's free from that school, for the first time ever (other than when the school forced her), my cousin decided to try an experiment and dye the hair on the front of her head a very UNNATURAL color; blue. It looked pretty cool but the dye didn't hold very well so it quickly faded back to white.

Also, a few people had been asking why the school only began giving her a hard time this year (when she's 18 and a senior). As I mentioned in the comments, my cousin began attending that school for her junior year in fall 2020. Prior to that she attended a different school in another city that was a little more lenient on their dress code, at least in terms of hair colors (i.e. you were allowed to dye your hair natural colors like blonde, brunette, etc.) She switched schools when she moved with her parents to where they currently live. This was during the height of the pandemic and all of the classes were virtual. Her parents were aware that the school had a strict dress code, but since the classes were virtual, a lot of the rules were relaxed, and it was only when in-person classes resumed last fall that they began giving her a hard time about her hair.

Lastly, if any of you YouTubers out there wish to feature this story in your videos (r/Rslash_YT), you have my permission to do so, on the condition that I remain completely anonymous (by that I mean don't use my Reddit username in your video).

Once again, thank you all!

&nbsp;

TL;DR: My cousin's school made her dye her hair to cover up her natural light streak in her otherwise dark hair (which they didn't know was the way her hair naturally grew) because they considered it to be an ""extreme"" hairstyle, and to not dye her hair again afterwards as dyed hair wasn't allowed. She did exactly what they told her to do, but once the white streak started coming back they tried to punish her for dyeing her hair, even though they had forced her to break their own rule by making her dye her hair in the first place.","Your ""unnatural"" hair color violates our dress code.

I'm F/29, ginger, tall, too thin, and am considered attractive. The only other thing I had going for me at the time was 4 years of experience as head of Research and Development for my company, 2 master's degrees, and was 1/2 way through my doctorate at the time. The IT manager and I took lunch together to discuss some of the problems facing us away from the fray and interruptions of the department. Considering the morning, a glass of wine was a welcome relaxer before lunch.

 All of a sudden, I hear a screech from the restaurant's entrance, ""There he is! Sitting with a whore!"" I look up and see a mid-40's woman pointing directly at our table. Before I know it, she's pushed her way through the restaurant to our table. She screeches, ""So this is your business lunch! A painted slut!"" (Granted, I was wearing mascara and lipstick.) IT guy tries to interrupt her, but she continues, ""This is what turns you on? Girls dressed like sluts so you can stare at her tits?"" (I was wearing a pinstripe women's business suit with a pale-yellow blouse with only the top button undone. And considering my B cup boobs, he'd need a bit of imagination just to locate them in this outfit.) While he tried to stem her ire, I reached in my purse and pulled out a business card. She would have none of it and pushed our salads off the table. 

""Ma'am,"" I said. ""Here's my business card."" as I extended my hand. She pushed it away and continued, ""You think I don't know how business works? They send whores like you to seduce men like IT guy into signing contracts! Everybody knows women don't know s\*\*t about computers!"" About that time, I saw 2 claws coming at me and backed away. Fortunately, restaurant staff arrived about then and worked to diffuse the situation. Unfortunately, that was when she turned on IT guy and the police had to be called. The last I saw her; she was being led out in handcuffs with IT guy trailing. She was screaming, ""You don't arrest whores in this city?""

I was supposed to be gone for 3 days. I flew back and returned to my office the next day. My boss was waiting for and crooked his finger for me to follow him to his office. Little did I know the story had already reached the office. My team was insufferable for the whole day and there were way too many giggles... especially after I found the see-through nighty hung up on my office door just below the sign: Conferences - $200/hour.

I didn't really care;¬†we never really got along well. She resents her dad for moving on so fast while her mom was single for another 2 years (I just want to add that me and my husband didn't know each other until after they had divorced. We met at a support group for IPV survivors. They divorced because she had an affair with a black man, and when she found out she was pregnant with Lana, she didn't know who the father was and couldn't¬†lie about it, but Lana did end up being my husband's.) which is fair¬†because we got married after only dating for 3 months, but it doesn't justify the constant awful behavior.

¬†
When I was pregnant, she refused to help me with simple tasks¬†like going grocery shopping or cooking.¬†and when¬†my son was born,¬†she would refuse to watch him. I don't expect much from her. I just want her to help with her brother. It's not like she doesn't want to watch him because anytime my husband asks her, she's more than willing.¬†

¬†
We are having a birthday party for Lana and I'm planning everything. Her mother is coming to surprise her since she usually only sees her during summer and holidays. While we were on the phone, she mentions Madison coming with her and I tell her she isn't allowed to come.

¬†
¬†
She got extremely angry¬†and started saying that Lana isn't my child and I'm robbing her of having a relationship with her mother. I understand Lana isn't my child, but I'm paying for everything, excluding the flight. Madison and her see each other for 2 months every year, and according to Adaleine, she's a total bitch the entire time.

¬†
I may be overstepping my boundaries, but I do feel like it is justified.

¬†
Also, adding that the person who hurt  my husband was not his ex-wife, it was his ex-from before, around the time, and he and his ex-wife came to terms


Edit: Lana doesn‚Äôt want Madison there she constantly insults her

When I mentioned that I started pole dancing, he wasn‚Äôt too excited about it, neither was my dad. They both want me to do ¬´¬†normal dances¬†¬ª whatever that means.

And I told him that‚Äôs not the same thing at all. I feel a sense of judgement when I even mention pole because all they can think about is the strip club.

s9r7bf,"**Collection:** [https://imgur.com/a/MvumBWo](https://imgur.com/a/MvumBWo)

I'm a woman of simple tastes. If you can smell it in a strip club, you can smell it on my wrists. Mind you, I'm neither a stripper nor a hooker. But I love tacky and girly fragrances. I have lots of cash but no prefrontal cortex, which is why I have more La Petite Robe Noire flankers than I can comfortably double-fist.

Here are my thoughts on all the Eau de Stank you see in my collection pic above. I'm not including any travel size fragrances today.

**Row 1:**

**Parfums de Marly - Delina Exclusif:** A one-spray wonder. It's strong. Absolutely NSFW if you're in my (actual, non-stripping) industry. It's like rose and strawberry mixed with almost-pristine vag. This bottle will last me until I'm old.

**Kayali - Musk 12:** Thought it smelled like nothing at first, but it grew on me and then I got the bottle. Nice for layering or if you wanna wear subtle.

**Kayali - Vanilla 28:** Oh my god this one makes me want to have sex with myself. Get this if you ever thought to yourself, ""Gee, I should really masturbate more often!""

**BDK Parfums - Rouge Smoking:** This is a sweet vanilla cherry concoction. There's something else interesting in it, but I'm clueless because my nose is a blunt force instrument. I spray this on my clothes because it irritates my skin.

**Lolita Lempicka - Lolitaland:** It's like a creamsicle. Did you know that Francis Kurkdjian was one of the noses behind this? Very cool! I'm gonna try layering it with BR540 and see how long I can go without throwing up.

**Louis Vuitton - Attrape-Reves:** My ex's French dad got me a Louis Vuitton candle and a sample of this was in it. This was one of my first full bottles. My tastes have changed since then (I swear just in perfume, in case my ex is reading...), but I still keep this and spray it for fun. I got this one in-person at the LV shop in B-dale's and they monogrammed it for me. Had to block out my initials to protect my hooker identity.

(**Side note:** my neighbor is smoking weed and it's coming into my apartment through the vents. Which fragrance should I spray everywhere to mask the smell?)

**Xerjoff - Starlight:** Finally, my search is over. A spicy fragrance I actually enjoy wearing. I like spicy smells usually, just not on me. This one's lovely on me. I told the lady at the counter what I like and she had me smell this. It was love at first sniff. It's expensive, like a ring. I spray it on my ring finger so everyone knows I'm taken.

**Guerlain - Samsara:** Blind buy. I recognized it instantly when I first smelled it. I wouldn't wear it myself because I'm too much of a trashy ho, but I like smelling it sometimes. It's like a headshop run by serious, mature women. They're selling some good shit.

**Lush - Kerbside Violet:** Five years ago, I had a mini of this one. It was my first fragrance. I finished it and forgot about it for years. Recently I was nostalgic for the B*efore Times,* so I searched far and wide for a bottle. The only Lush store in NYC with this in stock was the one at Herald Square. So I pushed a bunch of tourists out of my way to get my hands on the one and only bottle. Another thing I forgot is that, uh, Kerbside Violet is potent. If I wore it, the tourists would probably move out of my way for once.

**Britney Spears - Midnight Fantasy:** I was curious. It's yummy.

**Guerlain - La Petite Robe Noire Intense:** It's a fruitchouli and reminds me a little of LV's Attrape-Reves. This one's more blueberry and cotton candy. Lasts forever. It's fun and I enjoy having it in my collection.

**Row 2:**

**Victoria's Secret - Tease Creme Cloud:** This smells how it sounds. Who's DTF? Anyone wearing this, I guess.

**Lancome - La Nuit Tresor:** I blind bought this one because I wanted to try it and I heard it'd been discontinued. Oh this is so nice. Soft and sweet and pretty, like me! Really glad I went for it, wish I bought a larger size.

**Guerlain - La Petite Robe Noire:** The orig. Please drench me in that tart cherry juice. I like how medicine tastes but I'm not down to robotrip. So this'll have to do.

**Xerjoff (Casamorati) - Bouquet Ideale:** Christmas in a bottle. Cats always try to lick me when I wear this. Not sure why. Maybe it contains earwax or tuna.

**Xerjoff (Casamorati) - Dama Bianca:** I love this one so hard. There's a top note I'm not super into, but it fades quickly and leaves this beautiful phantom vanilla. Leaves a cute little trail everywhere. I'm marking my territory.

**Pacifica - Island Vanilla:** Cheapie. I can't get enough vanillas.

**BDK Parfums - Pas Ce Soir:** An unsexy name for a sexy fragrance. I don't know how to describe the vibe. It's simultaneously super dark and super light. Versatile, easy wear. I offend no one.

**Aquolina - Pink Sugar:** How could a cheap ho collection not have this?

**Lolita Lempicka - Lolita Lempicka Original:** Tasty AF. Am I candy? Eat me.

**La Petite Robe Noire Black Perfecto:** Like the original LPRN but with leather. Yum. I swear I'm not a dominatrix either.

**Carolina Herrera - Good Girl Supreme:** Like a cozy fall night, if you're me. Soft and dark and mmmm. Unfortunately, it finishes quickly.

**Row 3:**

**Britney Spears - Intimate Fantasy:** Master perfumer Britney Spears is at it again. I think this one smells better than most of the really expensive perfumes I've bought samples of. Fight me.

**Hermes - Twilly de Hermes Eau Poivree:** Another one-spray wonder. I spray it for nostalgia for the *Before Times.* I don't wear it outside because I'm not looking to choke everyone around me. I already told you I'm not a dominatrix.

**Guerlain - La Petite Robe Noire Ma Robe Velours:** Generic-ish warmer weather version of LPRN. Could probs do without.

**Kajal - Dahab:** This one's so good. It's fruity with a big touch of something else. Again, my nose is unrefined so I don't have the words to describe further. Oh, I should mention this one...just....can't...come. Lasts forever.

**Lolita Lempicka - Elixer Sublime:** I hated this one at first, which was surprising given that the accords are right up my alley and I love the original. I gave it a chance and found that the plasticy top note fades quickly and it smells like the original.

**Indult - Tihota:** Probably the best vanilla. One time I sprayed this before heading out and I got into the elevator of my building. A GrubHub delivery guy had just gotten out, so it smelled like pizza in there. A few floors pass and some other guy gets on. The doors close and he says to me, ""It smells like baked goods in here!"" I didn't know if he was talking about my perfume, the pizza, or both. I was way too high to ask him to clarify.

**Viktoria Minya - Hedonist:** This one's insane. Fruity floral meets rum and tobacco. I love this one to death but don't wear it often because it seems polarizing. Maybe I should put on ten sprays right before I take the subway so I get the car to myself.

**Hermes - Le Jardin de Monsieur Li:** Great summer scent. Kinda like D&G Light Blue Intense but with more going on. So I replaced Light Blue Intense with this one.

**Pacifica - Himalayan Patchouli:** Another fruitchouli. Inexpensive and comforting.

**Victoria's Secret - Very Sexy Orchid:** This one smells almost identical to BDK - Pas Ce Soir. Funny, their names vibe differently and their bottles present differently, but the fragrances are twinsies. It's hilarious to compare the Fragrantica seasonality votes for these given how they basically smell the same. Apparently a dark bottle means fall/winter night, and a light bottle means spring/summer day appropriate.

rrhcia,"This is not strictly a theist thing, but I believe such mentality is in high rates because of extremists in cults of Christianity and Islam.

Plenty of extremist Muslims support laws that demand women have a guardian for 'her own safety'. Well women should be allowed to choose if they want to be safe or not. 
So why don't we tell men, who are supposedly the threat to stay home? Why aren't they told that they need a guardian with a gun to watch over them? How about instead every man is in shackles? (No, I don't agree with this, but this is what women face when they are shackled in hijabs or niqabs that they do not choose themselves) 

Women in christian circles are told to cover up their shoulders or whatever because its their fault. I'm not arguing whether you should protect yourself or not, because it doesn't matter. When a person gets their wallet stolen, no one tries to arrest or punish the person who got their wallet stolen. But no, extremists actively want to make it illegal for what? For women to have sex?

Or Scream 3 addressing the sexual coercion of women in Hollywood way back in 2000, over a decade prior to the #MeToo movement?

The direct exchange of money (sugar) doesn't absolve men from needing to present as attractive, in whatever way that means to the SD. It seems some (not all) men in this lifestyle think that just offering a wallet is enough to guarantee the attention of attractive, young women. (It's not.)

For the best possible experience, SDs should invest time, energy, & resources into being as physically/ emotionally attractive as possible. Including: grooming & style, building a body you are proud of, learning how women feel sexual attraction, and doing those actions. As well as not doing other actions that turn women off (oversharing, texting every day for weeks like girlfriends, being unattractive, etc.)

Imo, men who struggle with women in non-sugar dating, will have the same problems in SR until the core issues are addressed, and overcome. 

Resources I recommend are working with a personal trainer, getting fashion/ image advice, reading books about seduction (Crucial). I have a list of 3 books all men should read on this topic, DM me if interested.",Sugar Relationships Aren't A Solution to Men's Problems With Women,2.0,2.0

I (25f) am about to start selling my used panties soon and my biggest concern is being as safe as possible and protecting my identity. I've been doing a lot of research but I still have a few questions I'd like answered before I get started.

1. How should I verify myself?

I know my customers might want to verify they're buying from the girl in the picture, but what's the best way to do that? All I know is NOT to hold a paper sign because photoshop.

2. How do I go about mailing them?

I bought a few puffy envelopes but I'm not sure if I would just put his address and a stamp on it and toss it in a post office drop box? Or do I need to take it into a post office/ UPS store every time? I read that it's important to pay for the tracking insurance, is that true?

ry122e,"Today, I made a observation regarding two episodes seasons apart, with the same dramatic angle played, but with reversing characters. Let's begin with the latter episode first, where Francine is furious with Stan during the Episode: ""Stan & Francine & Stan & Francine & Radika"" (S16, EP13)

In said episode, Stan and Francine once again travel into their own past, and encounter their younger selves. Francine admires how loving and attentive Stan used to be, and Stan ends up having Younger Francine come onto him, and he naturally assumes it's fine to sleep with her, because she is technically his wife. 

However, before they can even sleep together, Francine returns and is enraged at Stan, claiming that he cheated on her as soon as she turned her back on him, and implies that even if he slept with her past self, it's still cheating. Keep that in mind, because that is the hypocrisy in a nutshell. 

All of that is fine and good logic, except Francine did literally the exact same thing in the Episode: ""May the Best Stan Win"" (S5, EP12) A Cyborg version of Stan travels back from the future in an attempt to steal Francine away from his younger self. Stan is misled by his future self, and Cyborg Stan sleeps with Francine, and it is implied far more than just regular old sex. 

Stan is obviously outraged and shocked that she cheated on him, and Francine claims that it doesn't matter, because Cyborg Stan is still her husband, just a future version of Stan. 

Francine is a hypocrite. She is outraged at Stan for making out with a younger version of herself, and practically divorces him on the spot, and yet she slept with a future version of him and basically demanded that he be okay with it. 

And one might say, oh, Francine learned her lesson in MTBSW, and thus became strongly against sleeping with time variants of each other.

Except Francine doesn't apologize for sleeping with Future Stan. It is all played as Stan's fault, everything is his fault. Granted, he did lie to her, but a lie about something far in the future, doesn't really equate to cheating on your husband...","Francine, is a Hypocrite (S&F&S&F&R and May the Best Stan Win)",2.0,2.0

ru1zj1,"Hi. This is my first post and I‚Äôd just like to know what happens next and how I can protect myself from any repercussions.

To set the stage a bit I‚Äôm a CSL at a 24 hour gas station. Over the last maybe two months we‚Äôve had multiple people call out or just not show up for their shifts for no reason and give no notes to our manager. We‚Äôll surprise surprise it happened tonight too.

I worked 2 PM to 10 PM and third shift would com relieve me at 10. By 10:15 he hasn‚Äôt shown up and I call my manager. She for some reason is fast asleep and her husband answers telling me he‚Äôll ‚Äútry‚Äù and wake his wife (my manager) up. Well as I‚Äôm waiting for him or her to call me back I‚Äôm frantically calling everyone who is capable of working a third shift in our store to work. Long story short everyone either said they couldn‚Äôt or just didn‚Äôt answer their phones. By this point it‚Äôs 10:45 and I haven‚Äôt heard from anyone I texted my manager and told her I was locking the store and going home as I was not about to work a 16 hour shift. Unfortunately i do not have the keys to the store as the only one with keys is the manager‚Ä¶whose still fast asleep at this point. I locked the door that I could lock called my local sheriffs department and asked if they could keep someone at the store tonight to watch it. I would just like to know from anyone what happens next and how I protect myself? Thank you for your time.

{UPDATE} 
All right first off I want to say thank you to everyone for all of your kind words and support you‚Äôve made feel so included and loved and I just want to say thank you. ‚ù§Ô∏è

Now as for the store I wish I had more spice for you guys but I called the store and the manager picked up. I asked her if she was able to get in the store ok and she replied ‚Äúyea I was fine I don‚Äôt blame you for what you did‚Äù and that was that I told her I wouldn‚Äôt be coming in today and that seemed to tick her off as she paused for a good 30 seconds before saying ‚Äúok‚Äù. At this point though I don‚Äôt care I‚Äôm finding another job one that will treat me with respect I deserve and not treat me like some animal. Again thank you all so much for your kind words you‚Äôve all made my night a little easier!

{ANOTHER UPDATE}

Ok so this is more of a question asking what I should do as my manager just texted me saying ‚Äúdo not tell anyone about last night.‚Äù And ‚Äúit would get us both in trouble.‚Äù I know she‚Äôs telling me this to save her own ass but I feel like she could get in serious trouble for telling me to do this. I‚Äôm just confused is all and would like your guys help!",Just had to close my store because no one would answer there phones.,2.0,2.0
sazggk,"Alyssa woke with a start, her phone sounding off loud klaxons telling her she had 20 minutes to get ready for her first class.

*Fuck*, she thought, *how the hell did I sleep through 3 alarms?!*

She groggily rolled over, scooped up the phone, and clumsily swiped her thumb over the screen, silencing it.

She took a deep breath, and sat upright. It wasn't even light out yet, no class should be this early. Swinging her feet over the edge of the bed, she tried to find her slippers, remembering that she'd left them across the room.

""Of course,"" she sighed.

She picked up her phone again, checking her notifications. Three missed texts from Gina, a snap from Kylie, and a text from Josh. She smirked. She was pretty sure Josh wanted to make a move on her, but the boy was just too shy. She wasn't even sure how she felt about him, but maybe that would change if he'd just come out and say it.

Gina's texts were mostly raccoon memes, with one laying on the ground, like a puddle, sleeping, and the caption 'Damn I'm flat.' She was always putting her own body down. It irked Alyssa a bit, considering she thought Gina was such a beautiful person.

Kylie's snap was of her looking exasperated in an adorable white pleated top. At least, it would have looked adorable if her figure allowed it. As usual, Kylie's breasts stretched and split the garment, bulging it out in an unflattering way. The snap's caption read ""stupid fucking tits, why are reductions not covered by student insurance??""

*Champaigne problems*, Alyssa thought, rolling her eyes a little. Her own body was nothing to write home about. She had her problems with it, like anyone, but it was pretty modestly-proportioned. ""Wonder what it's like to have boobs that damn big,"" she mused. Josh's text was a simple:

`Hope you slept well`

She smiled. He really was very sweet.

She stretched, a good, long one, that made her shake a bit and crack her back. Her hands shook just enough to drop her phone, causing it to bounce and flip under her bad.

""Goddamnit,"" she cursed, and knelt down beside her bed, groping into the dark under it. As she blindly felt around, her hands brushed against something cold, and hard. Metal? Perplexed, she gripped it, and pulled it out.

""A...coin?"" She'd never seen it before. Never seen anything like it, actually. Minted on one side was a sharply drawn symbol. It was shaped vaguely like cross, but with many angled accents all over it. On the other side, a set of scales. It was about the same size as a half dollar, but was incredibly heavy for its size.

*Weird*, she thought, and put it on her nightstand.

She reached under the bed again, and found her phone. She hoped this wasn't an omen for the rest of the day.

She breezed through her morning routine, showering, brushing her shoulder length blonde hair in the mirror, standing on her step stool so she could see herself. Sometimes it was a real pain being 5'1"". As she grabbed her shoulder bag, her eye caught the coin on the nightstand. It really was a very pretty coin. Weren't found coins good luck or something? She pondered the point for a moment, shrugged, and put it in her pocket.

As she walked across the quad, she took a moment and closed her eyes, feeling the just-risen sunlight on her face.

*Alright*, she thought to herself, *maybe early classes aren't so bad.*

It was just barely warm enough for her to get away with wearing just her belly shirt and a pair of jeans. She checked the time and hurried.

Just barely beating the clock, she found a seat near the back of her first class: World History Before 1500. It wasn't the most stimulating class, but as most of it was memorization, she excelled at it even this early in the day. The instructor, Professor Willden, a forty-something with salt-and-pepper hair and a pair of bifocals that balanced low on his nose, cleared his throat, as he began taking role.

""Francis?""

""Here.""

""Julie?""

""Here.""

His voiced droned over her like gentle waves. She'd stayed up a little later than she normally did the night before, and it was catching up to her. 

""Gotta stay awake,"" she prodded herself, and started looking for something to fidget with. 

The pen she'd grabbed for noted wasn't a clicky pen, so that wouldn't do. She'd left that stimming toy Gina got her for Christmas back in her dorm. She reached into her pocket and felt...the coin. That would do.

Slowly turning it over in her fingers, she absent-mindedly mused on its weight. She wondered what kind of material it could be made of to be that dense. She she continued to flip the coin around between her fingers, her eyes wandered around the room. She was normally fairly social, but at this time of morning, she wasn't coherent enough for that. She'd spent nearly a semester with these same students and barely knew any of their names.

""Anatasha?""

""Here, Robert.""

Her ears pricked up a bit. Anatasha? She actually showed up for once? And calling the professor by his first name. How tacky.

One of the only students she knew by name, primarily because she was never in class. Anatasha had attended a grand total of 7 class periods all semester, by Alyssa's count. Yet, somehow, she always had one of the highest grades. A fact that she'd readily brag about to anyone who'd listen.

Alyssa was fairly certain what the reasons were, and they were hanging off the girl's chest. Anatasha had been blessed not only with flawless dark skin and beautiful hair, but a rack that seemed to defy logic on her otherwise svelte frame. Alyssa sighed, wondering how much the overly-endowed girl had done to ""improve her grades."" She narrowed her eyes at her. It wasn't fair. Why didn't she have to work as hard? Why did she just get blessed with a body like that? She felt the envy boil inside her for a moment, staring daggers.

That's when she felt the heat.

The coin in her hand began radiating heat. Not so much to be painful, but definitely enough to notice. ""What...?"" Alyssa gawked down at it. She didn't really have time to think about it though, as mere seconds after, she felt the heat spread to her chest. As it settled there, she felt an intense itching sensation, like a burning.

""Augh, fuck.."" she whispered to herself, wincing while closing her eyes. She dropped the coin onto her desk.

""Excuse me, is there a problem back there?"" Professor Willden's voice called out sharply. Her eyes snapped open.

""Oh, uh...no, sir."" She could feel her face flush a bit. She hated this kind of attention.

""Well, please, try to keep it down during class hours, will you?"" Then she noticed him do something he'd never done before. His eyes, just for a moment, flicked downwards, then back up again. As if he was...no, that couldn't be right. He didn't just check her out, did he?

It was at this moment Alyssa noticed the next strange thing of the day. A colossal weight tugging down her top, pulling on her shoulders. She looked down.

""Oh...my...God..."" The words barely choked out in a frightened whisper.

Alyssa was staring at the biggest pair of tits she'd ever seen in person. Large, pale, fleshy globes that strained the bra she had on, resting above her desk and nearly touching it. If she'd had to take a rough guess, she was fairly certain she'd cleared an H cup. Maybe bigger? It was hard to tell from this angle.

She began to sweat, panic setting in. The top she was wearing struggled immensely to contain the mountains of flesh threatening to burst through, but still seemed like it was sized for her. Her breathing became shallow and rapid. She had no idea what to do.

Until she heard a voice near the front. Anatasha's voice.

""Dr. Willden, could we go over the questions from last night?""

Alyssa's gaze snapped back up to her. Anatasha? Asking about homework? Was she in a parallel universe? Was this a dream? Nothing made sense anymore! But that's when she noticed.

Anatasha was flat as a board. Her beautiful raven hair bound up behind her in a messy pony, trailed down the back of a much, much smaller shirt than she'd been wearing only a moment ago. A shirt so small because it only had to cover up what were most likely a barely noticeable pair of AAs.

Alyssa began to tremble, doing her best to keep it together. Her head was swimming, thoughts swirling inside her head. Trying to put the pieces together.

The coin.

She stifled a gasp. Did...did the coin do this somehow?

Slowly, she rested her shaking hand on it, picking it up again.

""Breathe, Lyssa, Breathe,"" she chanted to herself. Maybe this would work. It wasn't any crazier than anything she'd just witnessed.

Clasping it in her hand tightly, she stared at Anatasha again. She focused on her chest, that flat, barely showing curve. ""Come on, come on..."" Alyssa whispered to herself, ""Take them back...grow...""

In her hand, the coin felt hot again. She didn't break her gaze, all her thoughts focusing on one thing: making that show-off a bimbo again.

The heat centered in her chest again, not feeling quite so uncomfortable this time, and as she focused, she saw what looked like the fabric of reality warping in real time.

It began slowly, but quickly accelerated. Small bumps formed in Anatasha's shirt, pushing out, swelling bigger by the second. Her clothing shifted with it, turning back to the top she'd had on previously. More and more mass added to the growing breasts, until they finally began to stop, resting back to what Alyssa remembered being roughly their original size.

Catching her breath, she looked down again. Back to her modest B cups, in the same baby blue bra she'd put on this morning. She exhaled, relieved. ""Thank God.""

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Roughly 50 minutes later, Alyssa sat in the quad, staring at the coin. She still couldn't get her head around what she'd witnessed. The coin had...changed reality...somehow. Shifted Anatasha's breasts to her, and rewritten reality around it. No one thought anything was amiss...except her. Could it really be true?

There was only one way to find out.

She looked out over the crowds of students. Some were eagerly trying to get to their next class, some were reading, some working on assignments, and some talking in little groups. Her eyes locked on to a cute couple off by themselves, sitting by one another by one of the many trees that dotted the property. Under different circumstances, she might have laughed a bit at their ridiculous size difference. The boy was probably near the 6'4"" to 6'6"" range, while his petite ginger girlfriend looked like a child next to him. She couldn't have been any taller than Alyssa herself. What was it with the short girls always wanting giants?

She focused on the boy. Imagined herself at his height, what that might feel like. To not have to look up at everyone for once. Once again, the coin heated up in her palm, and she felt it spread through her whole body this time. A bit of intense pressure pushed her outwards, upwards. She tried to keep her focus on him, and as she did, watched him dwindle. It was a bit like watching those character creation sliders on the Sims, as his clothes resized themselves fluidly to match his new stature. Down and down he shrunk, until he was nearly eye level with his partner. Alyssa then let it go, and breathed out.

Taking a moment, she looked down at herself, and stood up.

Way up.

She immediately felt the new center of gravity from her enhanced height. She was freakishly tall! Again, her clothes had reshaped to fit her, most likely being custom sized at this point. She was a giant! She goggled to herself, seeing over the heads of her peers. She suddenly remembered, and looked back at the boy whose gangly body she'd stolen. He looked to be about her height previously, maybe a bit taller, and sitting next to his nearly-evenly sized girlfriend. She looked a little more closely. Their body language had changed. They weren't entwined as lovers anymore under the tree, they were seated a platonic few inches apart. He was shifting nervously next to her while she read. Did reality change that much?

*Damn, I guess she really only cared about the height.*

She felt a pang of guilt ruining a relationship like that. While this was fun, she should probably return things to the way they were. She took a deep breath, and stared at the boy again, clutching the coin. Willing him taller.

Again, she felt the now familiar heat, and her vantage point began to lower once more. As she stared, the tony boy began growing again. Slowly at first, but rapidly accelerating. It was only a few moments before he'd return to his previous height. They were cuddled up once more.

""Jesus, the implications..."" she said aloud, ""I can't believe things shifted that much. This is...a lot.""

Just then, her phone dinged. Crashing back down to reality, she pulled it out of her back pocket and unlocked it. Another snap from Kylie. This one featured a horribly grainy zoomed-in picture of Alyssa herself, taken from behind her a good distance away. The caption read ""I seeee yooooouuu. lol"" Alyssa smiled softly. What a goofball. She got up and headed toward her waving friend on the other side of the grass.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

""Being a creep, huh?"" Alyssa joked.

""Oh come on, you seemed like you were in your own little world over there, I couldn't resist. My class got cancelled, you want to hang out here for a bit?""

""Yeah, sure,"" Alyssa replied, trying desperately not to let her mind drift too much to the coin in her pocket. She couldn't let this get out, it was too much. She was barely getting her head around it herself.

The two wandered to one of the stone tables near the center, and set their bags down.

Alyssa tried to grasp at topics of conversation. Something. Anything.

""Uhhh, so that top you showed me was cute,"" she started weakly.

Kylie cocked her head with a real ""Are you fucking kidding me"" look. ""Yeah, it would have been, if I didn't have these fucking planets here,"" she gestured to her abundant chest.

""I still think it looked cute,"" Alyssa half-heartedly responded, when suddenly her mind snapped to attention again. Maybe she could help, after all.

Kylie hefted her huge tits in her hands, sighing, ""Not as long as I've got these things. They ruin every cute top I want. It's really unfair.""

""Not for long,"" Alyssa said to herself.

She casually reached into her pocket, feeling the coin. Contact.

""You know I really did look into getting a reduction...but there's so many hoops you have to jump through...""

Kylie's voice trailed off, Alyssa was too busy focusing. Willing her friend's enormous, problematic boobs to shrink down. Become a much more manageable size. The heat built up in the coin, tightening around her chest again, as she watched reality warp and twist before her. As Kylie continued to talk, her massive, wobbling breasts moving less and less as she did. Alyssa could only imagine how much weight she was losing in the process. She suddenly broke eye contact, letting go of the coin as well. She didn't want to take too much, after all her friend should still have something nicely sized there. She breathed in, slowly getting her senses back to the present conversation. Kylie's voice trailed back in to focus for her.

""...but I'm sure you've done your fair share of looking into it, huh?"" Kylie smiled, stretching her back a bit, her proud, firm C cups curving out her shirt nicely, no longer threatening to tear her clothes asunder.

""I'm sorry, what?"" Alyssa had completely lost the direction of the conversation with her focusing.

Kylie rolled her eyes. ""Reduction? Y'know? For those giganto-bazongos?"" she gestured to Alyssa's chest.

She looked down at her recently altered body for the first time, her eyes going wide.

""Okay, maybe I took a bit too much..."" she said in her head.

Her tits were massive. Every bit as big as Kylie's had been, burgeoning the straps of the now severely beefed-up bra she was wearing. She thought she'd stopped the process earlier than this, but it seems she'd taken enough from Kylie to add on to her previous B cups, making her about the same size as Kylie was before. Perhaps this was a more delicate procedure than she'd thought.

""Oh, uh...yeah. I dunno, I kind of like them,"" she returned unsure of herself.

""I'm sure you get lots of attention,"" Kylie replied pointedly, ""Especially from Josh."" She stressed his name, giving a little eyebrow wiggle to go along with it. Kylie's brown bangs parted from a breeze as if to accentuate the point.

""Oh, shut up. He's sweet."" She hadn't thought about him at all since this whole mess started. How would her new body have changed their friendship? Hopefully not at all.

""Pretty sure he'd kill a man to get a shot at those things,"" she cackled.

Alyssa brushed her off, ""Yeah, well he wouldn't make a move even if that were true.""

Kylie shrugged, ""Yeah, you're right.""

Alyssa adjusted her bra strap. God, these things were heavy. It wasn't even 11:00 yet. What else would this day bring?

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Alyssa stretched her back with her hands for what felt like the thousandth time that day.

*How the fuck did Kylie stand having these things? I feel like my back is going to break!*

She looked into the bathroom mirror, getting a good long look at her body. They looked ridiculous on her tiny frame, bulging out the conservative shirt she was wearing. It was roughly the same color and pattern as her original shirt, just designed for someone trying to seem more modest with such an enormous set of boobs. She sighed. Taking a quick look under the stall doors, and determining she was alone, she quickly pulled her shirt up over the prodigious flesh that now hung from her. She noticed the bra she was wearing was a front clasp, which was interesting.

""I guess it's easier to get to than all those hooks in the back for a size like this,"" she said aloud.

With mounting curiosity, she popped open the front, unleashing her massive mammaries from their underwired prison.

""Fuck..."" she whispered, genuinely impressed with them. 

They sagged a bit from their weight, but not nearly as much as she thought they might. Pale, even skin covered them apart from the very bottoms underneath her nipples, which showed the faintest hint of a few blue veins. Her nipples themselves had grown immensely. She used to have what she jokingly referred to as ""glasscutters,"" small, hard nipples that looked as though they might hurt if touched the wrong way. Not anymore. What capped her enormous rack was a pair of huge, pink areola, with a set of fat nubs bigger than a pencil eraser. She bounced a little, watching them jiggle and sway. 

""Damn, I'm stacked..."" she said with a grin. 

As fun as they were, though, she knew she couldn't keep them. She'd only had them an hour or so, from her perspective, and she'd already ran the damn things into half a dozen students. Plus her back was already aching. While she idly hefted her fat tits, an idea struck her. ""Of course!"" she exclaimed, and quickly pulled out her phone. She was going to help two friends today.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

""So, you texted me just to give me the book I asked to borrow, huh? No other reason?"" Gina's green eyes peered at Alyssa suspiciously, sizing her up. She had sharp features that complimented her petite figure quite well. Alyssa never understood why she was always so down on herself, she was so pretty. The dark hair and green eyes combo was such an intense look, she always slightly envied her friend, but mostly wished she'd love herself more.

""Yup. I promise,"" Alyssa lied, ""Though...maybe I also just wanted to see you."" She stuck her tongue out, trying to act like the boat anchors stuffed in her shirt had always been there, and weren't stolen from Kylie's body a mere 70-some minutes ago.

Gina's face warmed, ""Awww, c'mere,"" and she reached over to give Alyssa an awkward side-hug. A behavior clearly necessary in this version of reality, where her tits would certainly get in the way otherwise.

""So how was class?"" Alyssa started, wanting to derail Gina's focus for a moment. She reached into her pocket, fingering the coin.

""Oh, y'know, ruthless. Early morning labs are brutal. Even when it's a simple titration, I feel like I've got a gun to my head.""

Alyssa breathed in, then out. Focusing. Willing the transfer. The heat was more tolerable to her now, she was adjusting quickly. After a few moments, she saw the tell-tale bulges in Gina's shirt. Gina was beginning to grow some nice, heavy tits. The swelling sped up, pushing and stretching, the hints of thicker, longer nipples showing themselves beneath the fabric. She was progressing wonderfully as she talked.

""Alright, that's enough,"" Alyssa decided, halting the process.

When her focus came back to her, Gina's trail of conversation hadn't stopped, but now, as she moved her body, a very respectable set of full breasts wobbled along with her.

Gina's hair was different as well. Longer, with braids now. That was an interesting change. Alyssa wondered if the increased confidence of her chest had made her more ready to express her femininity. Keeping track of changes was getting complicated.

Alyssa quickly glanced down to her own body, assessing she'd gone back down to a much more manageable and reasonable C cup, more or less. She could live with this. Full, but not over the top.

She nodded and smiled along with her friend, seeing the slight changes in her personality. It was evident there was more confidence, she was more bubbly, thriving. It made Alyssa feel genuinely good. She'd helped her closest friends today.

""Alright, well thanks for the book!"" Gina leaned over and gave Alyssa a quick hug, then walked down the hallway leading out of the building. ""I'll see you Saturday!"" she yelled as she left.

Alyssa suddenly went stone-faced. Right. Saturday. They were all going to that massive greek party, she'd forgotten. Today had been a little more than she'd been expecting, plans for two days in the future seemed too far away to care about right now. Sha glanced at her phone, checking the time. A little after noon. She suddenly realized she hadn't eaten yet today, and as if on cue, her stomach twisted uncomfortably. She really needed some lunch. Hopefully the on-campus food court wasn't too crowded.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

""A double cheeseburger, and can I get a cup of cheese with those fries please?"" Stress had definitely made her a little more hungry than normal. Some comfort junk food just sounded so good. The boy behind the counter handed her the meal, and waved her off. It smelled great. As she sat down in one of the corner tables to devour her lunch, her eyes scanned the area. There were a lot of people here, it was peak lunch time after all. 

*So many possibilities...* she caught herself thinking. 

As she took the first bite of her burger, she looked through the crowd, her eyes settling on the bodies of her peers. Looking at them as potential sources of fun. She spotted a group of friends, all gathered around a slightly-too-small table. She noted one girl in particular, sitting with her back to her. She had a head full of curly, dark hair that went halfway down her back, and Alyssa noticed her pants didn't quite fit her. The top of her crack was just barely exposed above her waistband, unable to completely cover the big, bubbly globes of her butt. She was clearly gifted with what some might say was, an absolute dump truck of an ass. Alyssa smirked as her mental gears turned.

Once again, she reached into her pocket, grasping the coin in her fingertips. Focusing her stare onto the girl, she willed another transfer. She felt the heat radiate out, this time focusing through her legs, then bum. She focused her breathing, keeping her attention on the plump, round buttocks of the unsuspecting student. Almost immediately, she began to see the changes take effect. She seemed to be ""shrinking,"" but really it was just the large padding of her ass disappearing beneath her. Her prominent crack retracted into her pants, as her huge backside deflated. At the same time, Alyssa noticed that she was sitting a little higher on her seat. After a few more seconds, she broke her concentration, and breathed out slowly. 

She appraised her most recent target, determining she was positively flat back there now. ""Chairs might be a little less comfortable by default, now,"" she chuckled to herself. She took another bite of her food, and stood up, trying to look as inconspicuous as possible. She immediately felt the weight of her own ass, counter balancing her backward. She couldn't wait to look at it properly. 

She maneuvered to the bathroom, just outside the food court, and ducked inside. She turned the corner to the mirror, then spun around to take a full look at herself. She felt like her face was going to split from the size of her grin, as it crept across her face.""GodDAMN,"" she said, and did the only thing she'd wanted to do if she ever managed to get a butt. She slapped it, hard. Even within the confines of her now painted-on jeans, her newly enlarged cheeks wobbled and rippled from the sharp contact with her hand. Alyssa was now the proud owner of a huge, fat, round ass. It threatened to split the seam of her pants any second. She bounced on her heels a little bit, making it clap and jiggle. This ass belonged in porn. 

Absolutely giddy with herself, she strutted back out onto the food court, feeling the heavy swing of her hips, compensating for the sheer weight of her thick, meaty backside. She loved it. She had a brief thought as she caught the eyes lingering on her form as she walked by, *Keep dreaming, I'll bet you don't have enough dick to get past all this.*

She came back to her table, sat down, feeling her plush seat cushion of a butt underneath her, and continued eating. She knew she was keeping this. Sitting in her literature class, Alyssa couldn't stop smiling. She could practically feel every pair of eyes on her massive rear end everywhere she went. The feeling was intoxicating. The way her pants hugged her, the way she could feel her underwear getting completely devoured by her cheeks, it was all too much. She could never go back. In fact...Her eyes scanned the room again. Just the shadow of what she was thinking of began to make her tingle, and she could feel herself getting the slightest bit damp. Did she dare?

It only took a few moments to pick her winner. Far off to the left, back by the other door to the classroom, a chubby blonde with an undercut and dramatic winged eyeliner. Alyssa scanned her up and down, noticing she was a bit thick just about everywhere, but maybe should wouldn't miss just a little of it? Alyssa grinned wickedly, and touched the coin again. It was becoming second nature to draw the power out and initiate the process. Again, existence twisted and the girl began to sink lower in her seat, just a bit. She gripped the coin firmly, and counted to five. Releasing it immediately after. The heat and slight pain were beginning to feel...good. She didn't have to look yet, she knew she'd grown plenty. 

She could feel the sides of her chair pressing into the middles of her huge buttocks. Her ass had outgrown the chair. She couldn't wait anymore, she had to look. She quickly, and as quietly as she could, moved out of her seat, and dashed out the door. Her balance was much more strongly affected this time, the immense weight pulling behind her, causing her to nearly lose her balance twice before finally stumbling in to the nearest bathroom. She laughed a little at herself, realizing she'd spent an awful lot of time in bathrooms today. 

Gazing in the mirror and turning around, her jaw hit the floor as she drank in the sight before her. If her ass was described as ""huge"" before, now it could only be described as ""titanic."" Just from estimating with her eyes, her enormous badonk stuck out fat and round at nearly five times what it had been this morning. She was, by weight, more ass than woman. Interestingly enough, her clothes had changed as well. She figured wearing denim with a massive dump truck like this would be nearly impossible, and thus, she was instead wearing a skin tight pair of yoga pants. They gripped her planet-sized buns so closely, she figured one could see if she had a mole. She bent over, and throwing a little of her back into it, made it clap. A resounding, meaty sound filled the bathroom as she did it. God, there was just so much. She was so enraptured by her body, she almost didn't notice the text lighting up her phone. She reached over to the sink where she'd set it, and quickly read through it. It was single text from Gina.

`hey...can we talk?`

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Gina's eyes were red and swollen, her nose congested from crying. Alyssa's hand was on her shoulder, rubbing her slowly.  
  
""I just...I don't get why  she'd do it over text..."" Gina sputtered out, ""Here, read it.""  
  
The text itself was quite lengthy, but the gist of it was pretty singular in its point. Christina had definitely dumped Gina over text. After nearly a year.   
  
""That's so cruel,"" Alyssa declared, miffed at the whole situation. Deep down, she was glad her messing with Gina's body hadn't altered her relationship, but for it to end like this, she almost wished it had.  
  
""Is there s-something wrong with me?"" Gina started to melt again. Alyssa held her closer.  
  
""No, no of course not. She pulled the bad move here, not you."" A plan was already forming in her head, and she'd need the rest of the day to do it. Today was so bizarre by this point anyway, why not embrace the insanity at this point? She given herself a several cup, dozens-of-inches TnA upgrade in the span of a few hours, what was one more thing?  
  
""You're going to be okay, love. I promise,"" Alyssa said comfortingly, holding her friend close. She needed to get to work.","[PI] A girl finds a magic artifact that lets her adjust the balance of traits between people, specifically the user has to be one of them, and only the user is aware that things changed.",2.0,2.0

My dad is a bad person. The reason he picked a fight with me last night is just because i simply mentioning my best friend's name in the middle of our conversation. He feel that i chose my friends who understand me for who i am rather than him who wants me to be his robot. I tried to calm him down, but he started calling me a loser and will be nothing in life. He then call me ungrateful brat for not ""appreaciating his kindness"" and for refusing to be controlled by him.

My nbro and i are like archenemy. We always compete for everything. I was mom's golden kid and he was dads golden kid. One time he start to smear campaign against me just because he thinks im not mature enough to be respected in the family. I always wanted to just get along with him, but after the fight, when he threatened to kill me, that was it. I just had enough of my crazy family.

The rest are either enabler or flying monkey. They always jump in to blame me in every argument. I wanna leave them so bad but i dont know what to do. My close one told me to just try to be patient without offering a way out. HELP",Someone help,2.0,2.0

r9sas1,"Hi guys for a quick info. English is not my main language so please forgive if there are some mistakes.

I M24 and my EX-girlfriend W22 have not been a couple for a good 2 years. However, the sexual attraction from my side is still incredibly strong and I think quite often about the old days and especially about our sex, which was great. (at least for me)
We often talked about the cuckold fetish, but never dared to really live it out in our relationship.
After we broke up, we had more and more conversations about her sex life. She told me all her stories and gave me a handjob meanwhile. Over time she became more and more dominant. For example I was only allowed to come when I say that I have a small cock and can never satisfy them more. Or she ruined my orgasm and laughed that I already cum even though she is not even halfway through her story.
It was great to hear how she had sex with other guys and how much better these guys were compared to me.
I was not allowed to fuck her. The only thing I was allowed to do was lick her and massage her feet. Sometimes she wouldn't let me cum at all, ruining my orgasm or letting me rub my cock against her leg until I came.
This went on for a while until she met her new boyfriend. She then just told me that he had the biggest cock she had ever seen and broke off contact.
She now lives in another city (about 6 hours by car) and we have completely lived apart.

A year after we broke off contact I got a lovely message from her: ""I'm visiting my parents for a few weeks and wanted to ask if you'd like to talk about old times :-)"".
I was incredibly nervous, but of course I said yes.
We met at a bar and we had a really great and fun evening. She then asked if she could come up, she would like to see my new apartment. In my head were already countless movies and I could hardly concentrate.
Of course we went up to my place and had a few drinks. She was meanwhile single again and I didn't quite know what will happen that ecening. When she was a little drunk, she asked me about the cuckold fetish and whether I still have this preference. She looked at me with her beautiful eyes and a cheeky grin, while I couldn't say a word because of panic. I needed a short moment and then answered her with ""no of course not, I have evolved and have now become more dominant"".
She started laughing lightly and asked me why I was so nervous then.
She reached into her purse and pulled out a Chastity Cage from her bag and put it on the table in front of me.
""So you're telling me this doesn't make you incredibly horny right now?"" i started to shake slightly and answered again with ""no"".
She then said ""alright let's make a deal. You get up now and if you have a boner I know you are still the same pathetic cuckold as before"". If I don't have a boner, I could fuck her right here and do whatever I want to her
I did not want to get up, because my cock was already hard for 20 minutes.
After asking several times I got up and went over to her. She took off my pants and started laughing loudly.
My dick is not really the biggest (4.5 inch hard).
She knew it I haven‚Äòt changed. All my underpants were already wet and I have never felt so humiliated.
She looked deep into my eyes and asked me ""so what are you?"" I answered in a low voice ""your cuckold slave"". (This was my regular answer for this question back then) I went down on my knees in front of her and lowered my head.
She stroked my hair and asked me ""so how do we get this cage on your little hard cock now? You have two choices. 
1. if you manage not to cum for 10 minutes no matter what I do to you, then I'll make you cum and you proved ne wrong. You really changed and are more alpha then i thought. But if you cum during this 10 minutes i can control you the way i want. No matter what. 
Option 2. you go just accept it like it is, go under the cold shower now and put ob the cage. You will accept the fact that you‚Äòre my slave.
I did not know what to do. After thinking for a while I took option 1 even though I knew I wouldn't last a minute. But atleast there was a small chance. This was also the answer she wanted to hear.

Option 1 then. For 10 minutes I must not cum, no matter what. She got up and went to the couch while I crawled behind her naked on my knees like her dog.
She rummaged a bit in her bag and pulled out a medium sized anal plug. She grinned in my face and said the 10 minutes will run once the anal plug is in my ass. That‚Äòs part of the deal.
She put it in my hand, without gel or anything else (I'm really not experienced with my ass, which is why that was impossibly hard for me) I thought long and hard about how I should put this, for me' yet quite large anal plug in my ass.
She turns on the TV and took her phone bored in the hand. After thinking for a good two minutes, I finally took the anal plug in my mouth to get it a little wet. She looked obliquely at her phone and said only ""I always knew what a pathetic beta you are"".
I felt it tighten in my stomach area. I have never felt so humiliated.
""All right, eyes closed and through"" I thought to myself as I put the anal plug in my little ass with my face contorted in pain. She couldn't believe it and had to pull herself together not to fall off the couch from laughing.
Then she suddenly got serious and asked me if I was ready. I nodded shyly and she grinned at me again.

GO the time is running. She walked around me and tied my hands behind my back. Now I was kneeling in front of the couch, completely naked with hands tied together and an anal plug in my ass, trying to concentrate on something else so I wouldn't explode right away.
She then sat back down on the couch and said she had a little extra. Suddenly the anal plug started to vibrate. I flinched in shock and pressed my thighs against my cock. I had never had such a feeling and I was now sure that I would never make it through the 10 minutes.
She then grinned in my face and told me ""I still have a surprise for you. Turn around"" she had her phone connected to my TV and opened a video folder.
When I saw what came then I was almost sick with excitement. A video of her and her EX (yes, the one with the huge cock).
I stared transfixed at the screen and saw her being fucked by this monster. She screamed and made noises in this video like I have never heard before.
Now she increased the level of vibration and whispered in my ear ""come for me my little slave. Come on a video of your ex girlfriend being fucked. Come and you can be my slave and if you're a good boy you may watch me live. I know you want that.""
These simple words were too much for me. I was shaking all over and had to lie down on the floor. I could not hold it any longer. I lifted my head and looked her directly in the eyes from below.
Her moaning in the video, the vibrating anal plug and deep look in her eyes from the floor was enough.
My little cock started twitching and I just ran out. I continued to look her in the eyes while getting light tears in my eyes. I've never cummed like this before. She didn't even touched my cock. On the floor was already a huge varnish while it still just runs out of me.
She then told me to come back up and get on my knees in front of her. I got up and looked her in the face again. ""Look at the phone"" the timer was just at 01:54 minutes and that was even though she hadn't even touched me yet.
She then put my head on her lap and stroked my head ""don't worry, we'll have lots of fun together again in the future. After you accept your place it‚Äôs clearly easy. You don't have to be ashamed. I always knew you were a little beta cuck.
Now lick the floor clean and go take a cold shower and don't forget to shave everywhere like a good sissy should. You will be back in 5 minutes""
So I crawled back and started licking my cum off the floor. The humiliation was almost unbearable, I knew that my life would change completely from now on

When I was done with the floor I quickly ran into the shower to clean myself up. She then came into the bathroom and told me to come out on my knees when I was done.
So I quickly got ready and then opened the door on my knees. She was sitting at the dining table again and had her cell phone in her hand. I crawled over to her and noticed how she was filming the whole situation. She gave me the Chastity Cage in my hand and said ""put it on"" I looked down at my little cock which looked even smaller and more ridiculous than usual after the cold shower. So I locked the cage with the key while she was still filming me. I looked at the key in my hand and knew how hard it would be to give her the key. But she made it even worse.
With the camera still in my face she said ""come on, beg me to take your key. Ask me to own your cock and therefore you"".
I had to swallow hardly and said in a very low voice ""please take the key"" she replied angrily that she didn't hear me and that I should speak louder. With narrowed eyes I now said loud and clear ""Please take the key to my cock"" she laughed again and asked me why I would want that. To which I replied ""because I'm a little Beta Cucky with a little cock and I'd love nothing more than to be your little slave"". She took the key and put her phone back in her pocket. ""I knew you hadn't changed a bit. In fact, you've become even more ridiculous.""
She got up and went to the front door. ""I'll get back to you in a bit.""
She opened the door and left my apartment.
Naked, on my knees and with a chastity cage around my cock, I stared at the door for 10 minutes, thinking to myself ""What just happened?

Please let me know how you liked this story. I have quite a few others.

So, I've decided to broaden their vocabulary of insults by teaching them some of the ones we use here. I started with one of my favourites:

*""Dear USian friends. It's time we enriched your vocabulary of insults to include some of the best from the NZ/Oz (and by extension the UK, because crossover). Today's new insult is:*

*COCKWOMBLE (cock-wom-bull)*

*Use it to describe someone who is insanely stupid or inappropriate.*

*Repeat the following: ""Alex Jones is a complete and utter fucking cockwomble.""*

*That felt good, didn't it? I'm sure it rolled off the tongue better than generic terms like, ""asshole"".*

*I expect you to practice using the term and impress your friends with your newfound vocabulary.""*

rw1uhv,"For me, it's just a preference like any other. I'm convinced that those people who despise guys with this preference have zero problem with girls having a height preference. But absolutely everything you could say against sexual past preference could be said against height preference.

""You just are insecure of your sexual performance"" well, you just feel insecure about your height. Who cares?

""It's the result of patriarchy for you to want a modest girl"" It also is the result of patriarchy for you to want a taller guy. Who cares?

""You are misogynist"" Ok, so I guess you are heightist (it's a really thing trust me). And even if either of these statement were true, who cares?

""You making girls feel bad for enjoying their life"" I could say you are making short guys feel bad for literally living. Again, who cares?

No one should care about the preference of anyone. And if you really want to play the stupid game of ""which preference is legitimate"" you would lose because there would be way less reason legitimating height preference than sexual past preference. At least one of them is a better representation of who the person is.

But again playing this game is just stupid because you shouldn't care about the preference of random people.

I'm using the height comparison because it's the one I can the most relate to as a 5ft4 guy. Yes there was a point in my life where I despised every girl having a height preference. Saying things like ""they shouldn't care about my height but who I really am"". But the thing is, I was extremely insecure about my height at this moment of my life.

All this to say I too am discriminated in the dating world. In fact, I've been told straight up that I was cute but it wouldn't work because of my height. And as a 5ft4 guy confident about his height, I can say that I couldn't care less if a girl don't want me because of my height. I don't take it personal, because it's just a preference. The same way, I think girls shouldn't take it personal if a guy want someone with a more modest past.

Edit : Thanks to most comments, I now have a response to my question.

Writing this post I didn't think about the simple fact that most men who want a woman with a modest past are this way because they shame them. I agree that it's despicable to shame anyone for enjoying their life. I guess my case is different though. In fact, my preference is not directly for women with a modest sexual past, but one with a similar sexual past, which in my case (for the moment) means a modest sexual past. Admitting in the futur I have slept with 20 women, I would prefer a woman who has slept with more or less 20 men. I totally respect women with a prolific sexual past (they do whatever they want). I just wouldn't want to be in a relationship with one of them (for the moment).",why is it so much despised for a man to want a girl with a modest sexual past?,2.0,2.0

s51j2p,"Currently driving North from Sydney and stopped at the Taree service center for a coffee. Options are mcdonalds, subway, kfc and 'coolabah cafe'. I noticed they're signage has had a bit of a refresh... And it got me thinking about the type of business Coolabah cafe is. 

The service center was heaving... to paint a picture, flustered parents with bags of maccas looking for a free table. Huge lines for petrol bowsers. Shirtless and shoeless men munging into zinger burgers. The noise of it haunts me.

Despites the hundreds of hungry travelers filling up the service center like sardines cuing for big Macs and meatball subs... One retailer had no line at all. And that's where I went for my coffee.


There was no one in line for Coolabah. Not. One. Person. I tried to remember if there coffee was good, but tbh, like many others I've always steered clear of pit stop carverys / bain-marie / wraps and sandwiches and instead opted for the predictability of a fast food giant made burger. 


Walking back to the car, coffee in hand, the questions were swirling in my head... Who's salavating at the thought of roast beef that's been sitting out for unspecified period of time? Why is their smallest coffee $5? And most confusing, how do they stay afloat? 


Then I was struck with this theory... What if KFC, maccas, subway and caltex all chip in rent for Coolabah cafe, to avoid another competitor moving in the the service center? You know, one that could do consistently good coffee while offering a ""fresh"" alternative to fast food (e.g. Oliver's or similar). Is that why Coolabah Cafe exists? Is there a name for this type of business practice? I would love to hear your theories on the matter or your Coolabah Cafe experiences.

I‚Äôm not one to shy from more work & overtime, but this is ridiculous. I have my normal days off and I have things planned on those days because I work swings and a lot of times mixed swing & graveyard, and I usually sleep during my workdays if I‚Äôm not working.

I looked at my new schedule and I‚Äôm working 8 or 12 hour shifts everyday until my last day, with no days off until then. I questioned my supervisor about this, and he texted me that there are ‚Äúno normal days off‚Äù and he tries to keep it consistent but he couldn‚Äôt this time. He told me this schedule is because of me terminating my employment. He then texted me and said if I shred my two-week notice and stay with the company, he will give me my normal days off again.

I‚Äôm straight up thinking of just quitting at this point, fuck making it to the two week mark.

Rant over.

Edit: Hey guys, did not expect this to blow up so crazy. Thank you all for your replies. Y‚Äôall have really opened my eyes on what I should do, and I‚Äôll be resigning from my position immediately tomorrow morning. 

And I know a lot of people are saying this is fake, trust me I wish it was. It‚Äôs so perplexing to me that he would text me this, especially if they‚Äôre trying to keep employees (we are draining employees at an extremely quick pace already). Honestly it‚Äôs his fuck up, and I will be letting HR and the higher-ups above him about this. 

I do have text message proof of all of this, and I know a lot of people want me to expose the company, but I‚Äôm trying to be anonymous as possible by not mentioning company names, positions, location, etc. hope y‚Äôall understand.

First of all, the update added nothing. Nobody gives a flying fuck about the skins, especially when 2 of them look like the YBA moderators. And we got ANOTHER RNG based event, but this one manages to be WORSE.

For the Halloween event, the candies weren't SUPER rare and you had a 100% chance to get one from 1v1s and SBR. The Xmas one? NOPE. Presents are almost, if not MORE rare than Lucky Arrows, and you aren't even guaranteed one from 1v1s and SBR.

Also, Stand Trading? Seriously? We're turning this into ABD now? And before you say ""it won't turn into ABD for X and Y reasons"", every server I went into was filled with ""TRADING X FOR Y"" or ""DOES ANYBODY HAVE X STAND?"".

Oh and SBR, fuck that garbage gamemode that is never being fixed. Every server has at least 1-2 exploiters and it's laggy as shit. It got to the point where I had to give my Lucky Arrow for TW:OH cause I'm not going into that shit hole EVER again.

And finally, Idk if it's just my shitty laptop, but public servers are laggier than private ones? How the fuck does that even work? This means that I can't even get MIH because the frame drops make me not be able to parry the easy to parry moves. And before you say ""skill issue"", the AI does not help AT ALL. It's super buggy and half the time they get stuck on the fucking floor or sniff 5 grams of coke and go flying around like idiots. Also DIO OH managed to barrage me twice in a row, tf??

s6tg4g,"Hey Sylas mains! My name is Rime and I'm an ex content creator and now work for Cloud9!

 This season I reached challenger on NA with a 67% winrate on Sylas!. I'm here to help players with some guidance on how to play Sylas in season 12 and what the best builds/runes are in my opinion.

For some quick resources on what to build I frequently use [https://lolalytics.com/lol/sylas/build/](https://lolalytics.com/lol/sylas/build/)  to see item winrates on Sylas and what items pair together well.

As for a Sylas guide I believe that Coach Curtis currently has the best Sylas guide explaining laning phase and his identity [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOxVESxDgok&ab\_channel=CoachCurtis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOxVESxDgok&ab_channel=CoachCurtis)

Here is my opgg if you want to see my builds: [https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=rime](https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=rime) (dont mind diamond last season it decayed from GM)

Builds: Sylas has a ton of options on what items he can buy and almost every ap item is viable on him. However some items are generally MUCH stronger than others that you should purchase when you can 

Mythic: Everfrost. Everfrost is the best mythic in 99% of games. Everfrost synergizes extremely well with sylas because it guarantees being able to hit Q2 and E2

IMPORTANT! Strongest AP Items: Dark Seal, Fiendish Codex, Cosmic Drive, Shadowflame, Stopwatch, Void Staff! 

Dark seal is 124% gold efficient with 0 stacks and is 400% or something gold efficient fully stacked. Build dark seal every single game, even if 0 10 

Starting items: Dorans ring 2x potion, corrupting potion, and dark seal refillable are all good. I prefer to go dark seal refillable when I can but sometimes opt into corrupting potion vs lane bullies like Leblanc and Zoe

First recall: Dark seal or Lost chapter are ideal. Amp tomes are a garbage item as a standalone. If you recall with 900 gold as Sylas first recall I STRONGLY BELIEVE it is best to buy dark seal + corrupting potion instead of 2 amp tomes. I frequently go dark seal + corrupting + dorans ring if I cant afford lost chapter because it helps Sylas weak early game and feels REALLY good to have

Shadowflame is good if you are building sorc boots (stacking magic pen is op when enemy team has no Magic resist). Build shadowflame every game vs Lux ,Lulu, Karma or any shield heavy teams, the item is basically serpents fang

Void staff if the enemy team has 3+ people with magic resist. EX. triple merc treads

Zhonyas if you need to dive in hard in fights with an ult like Malphite or Blitzcrank

Boots: Ionian, Sorc, and Merc Treads are all viable. Merc treads are good when you are playing vs a heavy cc support and a mid that has high burst (sorc + ludens build path). Ionian vs Sorc is personal preference, I prefer sorc boots because with more ability haste I just go oom more often haha

&#x200B;

Runes: First Strike, Magical Footwear, Biscuits, Cosmic Insight + Presence of Mind + Legend: Tenacity

This rune page is noob friendly and heavily rewards snowballing if you happen to get ahead

I strongly believe this to be the strongest rune page on Sylas. Why First strike? The rune is simply overtuned and does way too much. The inspiration rune tree is also insanely strong and synergizes well with Sylas. In a standard 25 minute game First strike will be giving you 500-1000 gold and extra damage dealt. In games where you can snowball you can get 2000+ gold in a 30+ minute game. Sylas has always been a stat check champion with his high base damages and with him having the highest base hp at 18 second only to kled+skaarl (2480hp at 18).  And this rune page is essentially a stat check rune page that helps propel sylas into late game faster. THE REASON you run first strike is for a 15 minute powerspike. You will have free boots from boots rune and will have 200-500 gold from first strike. This is everfrost + T2 boots at 15 minutes, meaning you are 500+ gold up on your opponent that has extra electrocute or comet damage whatever it is. By 20 minutes in you will essentially be up a blasting wand or a kindlegem on them

Why First strike into ranged? First strike is a mid-late game rune it is not meant for laning phase. Its the same concept as how talon/zed jungle run first strike. You cheese an opponent with 10% damage increase and get gold for it. Champions that are meant to take first strike like viktor corki are only making 10-20 gold a trade with it during laning phase, Sylas makes a little more because he is melee but its hard to proc if the opponent is smart.  The rune kicks in mid game when you have everfrost + tier 2 boots. If you get in 1 full combo with it you will get +80 gold which is insane. SYLAS IDENTITY IS TO TRADE HEAVY IN LANE. he has so much healing in his kit that he is rewarded for trading aggressively unlike corki, viktor, etc. and so he naturally benefits from first strike because of all the skirmishing

Free boots are the most broken rune in the game, biscuits help Sylas weak laning phase and help him from going oom with his awful early game csing. Cosmic insight makes flash cooldown 4 minutes instead of 5 and the item haste is nice as a champ that builds everfrost + zhonya. 

&#x200B;

Secondary runes? Presence of mind + Legend: Tenacity

Presence of mind feels great on Sylas and mana refresh after a takedown helps a ton with early skirmishing as well as aggressive trading in lane phase. Legend:Tenacity because playing with 0 tenacity feels really bad as a bruiser that has to jump into the enemy team. Manaflow + Transcendence or second wind + unflinching or sudden impact + x rune are all viable. I really like presence of mind and am used to the mana refresh from running conqueror all of last season

Why NOT conqueror rune? Sylas is borderline assassin/bruiser but not quite bruiser. In most teamfights he will get 1-2 full combos off which isn't enough to make use of conqueror. Compared to an Irelia or Jax he does not optimize the rune well enough to use it unless you build somewhat tanky. The rune is nice and viable but I find that in most trades conqueror is fully stacked then the fight is over before you get to really use it. In a 25 minute game conqueror will have healed sylas for 500-800 along with added damage whereas first strike is 500 gold + 500 damage along with free boots rune.

As a side note If it works it works. If you are winning with conqueror stick with it. I have been finding a lot of success with first strike and will continue to use it because of that success

Summoner spells? IGNITE, sylas is high mobility and good at picking up kills, new TP is bad. As a bruiser Sylas thrives in skirmishes compared to control mages like ahri lux viktor corki etc. Any fights are good for Sylas because he can flash w ignite etc. 

Ability max order? Start E level 1, Max W. If you are constantly getting shoved in by champs like Ahri with strong waveclear you'll want to put points in Q to match their waveclear

Combos? Use E1 to dash into their face so that E2 is easy to hit, if you are going to trade in laning phase trade HARD. Dont W them then E1 away. 

Ideal Combo is E1 > Everfrost > Q > E2 > AA > W > AA > AA > AA. 4 empowered aa's is ideal

In teamfights ideally someone on your team engages first then you jump ON TOP of a carry and everfrost them into a full combo.

When is Sylas weakest and strongest? Sylas is weakest level 1,2,3. He is basically melee sona, be prepared to give up cs if you have to. Sylas wins games by being highest level in game through high cs or solo kills. When you play Sylas play for levels because of his insanely high base stats. He gets a big spike with everfrost completion because he can now full combo people without missing Q2 or E2. 

TLDR: First strike rune page, Everfrost mythic, Dark seal every game,  Dring and corrupting potion are better than amp tomes, Max W first \~ points in Q if you are getting hard shoved in and have to keep up. Sylas is strongest mid game with everfrost for getting a full combo on carries. Trade heavy in lane, frequently use potions and recall. Take Ignite not TP.  Play for levels because Sylas has insanely high base stats. 

I know that less than 1% of sylas players use first strike but I highly recommend you try it at least once before hating on it! Dont copy the meta just because its meta

Thanks for making it this far, hope this helped give some guidance. Feel free to ask anything, I'm  more than happy to answer any questions or discuss anything. Also if anyone here streams Sylas feel free to link your twitch and I'll stop by :3   Always enjoy watching Sylas

This woman has endured childhood sexual trauma at the hands of classmates, family members, and supposed friends. It still makes me angry to think about the things she has had to endure and the lack of support and blatant victim blaming she has received.

My husband's response wasn't to say ""Well I don't do that,"" or even ""Not all men are like that."" He didn't say ""There are good guys out there,"" or anything of the sort.

He said, ""Because they're jerks.""

And then he fucking listened to what she had to say.

It's that simple. Shut up. Listen. If you can't be supportive, at the very least don't get defensive.

That is all.

sd9j6f,"(Sorry this is a long read but I didn't want to leave anything out, bear with me)

I have been actively trying to get my ID now for a number of years and have had no luck whatsoever. The main problem being that not only do I not have any form of identification on record and never have, I also don't have a social security card, which was lost a long time ago.

I've seen people asking the same thing on the web, but I've yet to see answers that can provide me with a clear line of action to take with obtaining a lawful identification, so I'm making my situation known here. 

First of all, as stated, I'm 24, didn't finish high school because of a family struggle, didn't enroll in college, am unemployed, & I live in Tennessee. 
The documents I need regarding getting a standard renewable license in Tennessee are as follows (all have to be original documents, not copies):
- Proof of citizenship
- 2 Proofs of residency
- Proof of full social security number 

The proof of citizenship I plan on submitting is my birth certificate.
Examples of proof of residency: bank statements, utility bills, paychecks, voter registration, etc. Now, I don't have either of these specific documents because these are all things you're only eligible to get when you have an identification license. 
      However, I found a form called the Affidavit of Tennessee Residency that I filled out that says my housing is provided by family or friend (currently living with family), and I can provide 1 other proof of residency to go along with that, like the utility bill which I plan on using. 
So hopefully doing this can be valid as proof of residency?

Then there's having the proof of a social security number which of course I have nothing for, not a card, or even a W-2 form, payroll stub, or 1099. I just know my social security number & that's it, which isn't enough apparently.

And to obtain a replacement social security card in TN, one of the documents required is an identification license (& a passport which i've never been issued either)

This is where i've been feeling like there's a serious issue with the way this whole system works..
there's a plan available for immigrants who have never had a social security number, and for students who can use their recent high school transcripts in place of a SSC, but nowhere anywhere can I find a procedure in place for people who USED to have a social security card, but lost it AND are not students or have a job in the workforce.

I've made numerous calls the social security offices explaining my situation, written letters to them (as suggested by a social security office administrator), had them explain to me a suggested course of action to take, did everything they told me to do, only for my application to get rejected every time. 
I was told by a social security representative over the phone that all I would need is my birth certificate and my high school transcripts and go to the dmv to get a state ID... is this really true? I read that high school transcripts don't work for people over 18. I'm starting to think a lot of people at my local social security office have no clue what to do themselves. 

Could anyone offer me some guidance on what to do to guarantee that i'll get my application accepted? Am I missing something? Are there any loopholes within this system that I should be made aware of? I don't want to have to move to another state like California where proof of social security isn't required to get an ID, but maybe as a last resort? If anybody could help me it'd be much appreciated, just trying to get a little bit of freedom here.‚úåÔ∏è",üÜò (TN) In desperate need of obtaining my first ID at 24 yrs old. Please help,2.0,2.0

sa6tuz,"Posting on behalf of my sister. She lives in a cul de sac and over the past year has had a nightmare with a particular neighbour that frequently parks behind my sisters car, blocking her in. She is often up at like 4:30am for work and has been late a few times now as a result.

The excuse from the neighbour is he has expensive tools in his car so will park near his house, regardless. 

Over the years there‚Äôs never been an issue like this. Parking can be tight but no one blocks each other, people will park a bit down the road if needed or if they do it‚Äôs infrequent and with the others permission.

My sister has approached him 3 times now to say not to block her in as she is often up early for work. He just doesn‚Äôt give a shit. If he had a better attitude we maybe could come to come agreement, we understand parking can be tough but he‚Äôs not interested.
We‚Äôre at our wits end with him and want to see what legal recourse we may have.

As an example, and what prompted me to look for advise.. today he blocked her in and she noticed him looking at her car and giving it the middle finger.. he‚Äôs obviously immature.

What options do we have? 

*This is all on street parking, no drive ways involved.

Edit; I should clarify, this isn‚Äôt Parallel parking but like a parking bay.. that‚Äôs how people park in the cul de sac, the other car parks right behind her leaving no room to move out.",Neighbour keeps blocking car in,2.0,2.0

s7y1jc,"I know that women say that they want men to open up completely. The thing is that what we want is not always what is best for us, our relationship and our partner.

So here are my reasons on why it is better to not open up completely.

 1. Opening up also means committing ourselves. Once man fully commits he has been conquered, and relationship can become boring.

2. If woman knows what her man is thinking she will often push things to the braking point. If man doesn't open up she won't know where the braking point is, and her own dread will keep her away from pushing things too far.

3. If you were fat and then you lost fat and got fit women will still find you ""artificial"" because you weren't born built like some Greek God. Similarly if you were a giant pussy in the past and became a man through time women will consider you to be fake.

She doesn't want to find out about your traumas and emotions so she could help you. She cares about those because knowing those gives women power... that's why they gossip so much. Knowing those enable her to rate you better as a partner, it enables her to know how far she can push things, and enable her to know when to dump you.

Thinking they‚Äôre getting away since they had cum so much they can‚Äôt speak. That is until you take what is yours and watch them cry. Watching thing squirm with little strength remaining as their poor body strains against all pleasure. Truly a unique cry‚Ä¶that and they won‚Äôt cum from your use after that.

Now that the tides seem to be shifting with an increase in Victorians who oppose a mandate of a 3rd dose, they keep calling it ""Brigading"". 

It's not an anti-vax brigade team who have come here to downvote anyone pro 3rd dose mandate, it's just Victorians expressing their opinions the same as it was before. Only difference is now, some people have changed their opinions as things have developed.

I don't care if you are pro or anti mandate, that's not what this post is about. It's about thinking one group has entitlement to a reddit page over another when everyone should have a fair say.

Stop calling it a brigade and just accept for once that people are allowed to have different opinions than you, and that you should as always, only be downvoting people who aren't actually here for dicsussion. Not people who have a different view than your own.



Edit:
Just to justify why it is not brigading, heres the defenition.

‚ÄúBrigading‚Äù is a term that originated on Reddit for a coordinated attack by a group of users of an antagonistic subreddit.

Point of difference is that there is no coordinated group in this instance. It's just individuals commenting by themselves, on both sides.

Otherwise you could argue that pro mandaters are brigading as well.

How she lays in bed all damn day while Bobby takes care of the kids despite her finessing Bobby into marrying her because he‚Äôs a sensitive and caring man when in reality, she was just taking advantage of him.


That scene after they find Uncle Jun after he was wandering off in Newark and She tries to convince Tony they should do something was really one of my favorites. Tony really just let her have it and just call her out on ALL of her bullshit. It was even the sweeter because Bobby was full, front,  and center during  the whole argument. You can tell she really got triggered when Ton said: ‚Äú you‚Äôre gonna do to this man what you end up doing to all of them‚Äù because she knew he was right.

Richie was right for punching in her in her stupid mouth. I didn‚Äôt feel bad. I think he knew what she was, but unfortunately for him, she knew she couldn‚Äôt fully manipulate Rich like did with Dozens of men and eventually Bobby, so she had him killed. That‚Äôs what I honestly think. Rant over.

rw36ub,"So years ago back when I was 6 A dog attacked me and ended up ripping half of my face off which required a lot of surgery and stiches, Growing up was very tough for me cause I always use to get bullied and around puberty is where I started getting interested in the opposite sex. However, I noticed that girls just never use to give me attention and I Remember running home crying once cause the girl who I had a crush on made fun of me because of my face.

I got bullied quiet a lot to the point where I eventually just didn't care and I ended up picking up martial arts which gave me a lot of confidence, Yeah I might be ugly but at least I know how to break someones neck if I wanted to and eventually the bullying stopped cause the bullies knew that I could handle myself (I also got taller and more muscular which made me more intimidating)

Im still a virgin at 24 and I understand, Im ugly but that's why Im just focusing on the money cause Im eventually going to use money to buy myself a wife. I also really want kids and to be a father but I know that no woman is going to have kids with me unless I have money.

Another thing is that although I have an ugly face but Id never date a fat woman for example cause im not attracted to them, I know that I sound like a hypocrite but Im a visual person. I know personality is important but if im not physically attracted to a woman then I couldn't care how funny or interesting she is

I know people will say ""But that's not love"" But I couldn't care now, I want marriage and kids just like everyone else but If I have to buy it then so be it. I want sex and you don't know it feels seeing everyone around you get sex/hookups while you don't, It makes you feel like shit and im sick of jerking off to porn (I want to experience the real thing)

So what If I have to pay for sex as well? I have sexual feelings, I want to experience sex and although your average woman can easily get sex for free but as a man who has a deformed face I'll just have to pay for it

At least if I have money then A woman likes me for something, Im just really working my ass off and studying like crazy but I'll get money eventually cause im a hard worker

To be honest Im not forcing women to date or have sex with me and I can understand not being attracted to me but I just wish over the years that people (men and women) Were more respectful.",(M24) My face is deformed but I wish that I could find love,1.0,2.0
sa1yo7,"If I will ever get to give myself advice when I was younger, this would be my advice:

* You can be right all the time, but you need not to prove anybody that you are right. You ain't gonna get any joy after proven being right, the only thing that's gonna happen is - you being perceived as self-righteous hypocrite asshole. You gonna lose close people, you don't want that.
* You are confusing to a lot of people. People will misunderstand you and leave you for something you never said or did, you can't do anything about that.
* Study empathy and apply it whenever you need to. Study functions and adapt how to talk to people on the basis of their personality type. It will benefit you in the long run.
* If you find a like-minded friend, cling to him/her forever. It's tough finding a like-minded person, with similar goals, similar life expectations. 
* You ain't a freak, a maniac, or an abomination to mankind. I know it hurts, but don't try to change yourself for these hurtful words.
* Many people will try to ""figure you out"". Let them understand you. They are genuinely trying to know you. Do not be afraid and let your guard down.
* Learn to calm yourself down when you are in the \*\*Angry over small things\*\* phase of your life. Use your words wisely cause it's gonna cause more long-term damage than you will ever realize.
* Take action for the god sake, nothing will ever happen if you don't PHYSICALLY get out there and do it.
* You can't save the world
* Learn to accept yourself as you are.
* Do not try to fit in.

rw4k28,"I had this girlfriend way back. Let‚Äôs call her Winona because she looked a lot like a young Winona Ryder except she was naturally tan. Beautiful olive Greek skin. Eyes were this dazzling green color with a spray of yellow gold around her irises. Sunflowers in a field.

I was very young but already emancipated from my parents due to my‚Ä¶circumstances. She was 18. 

It‚Äôs no wonder I fell for this one. Gorgeous hourglass figure. Nice big boobs very early. One of the girls that came back from summer and you were like **oh hi** can we talk I have a huge crush on you come here and let me tell you how you make me feel
I‚Äôm nervous and excited aren‚Äôt you let‚Äôs get to know each other

I say this in the sweetest way. Winona was a really hot cumslut. Other girls would walk up to me in the hall and tell me that Winona had showed them her pussy in the bathroom at the skatepark the day before. ‚ÄúLook, I shaved my pussy!‚Äù, she would say. It happened nearly every time she shaved her pussy, too. I was so turned on by her exhibitionism. Her body was so hot and she regularly had her tits out, no matter who was around. Guys would be like dude, do you know your girl is flashing me her tits all the time? I‚Äôd be like ugh I love you Winona 

I did not realize her exhibitionism would quickly include me. You wanna ride with Winona she needs you to ride shotgun, not backseat. I get rather comfortable with her pulling my dick out and giving me sloppy blowjobs with her little eager mouth when I was just sitting around with my friends. 

I could be playing a video game with them and she would unzip my pants and just give me great head. Or suck me off for a few minutes then just put it away and laugh outside at the skatepark, not even hiding behind anything. 

There were so many times they just watched. Or were like wtf. Girls, especially would be like **oh. My. God.** what are you two doing? It didn‚Äôt turn into a line of sexy women waiting to learn how to suck my dick. But, more girls looked at me as a sexual being‚Ä¶her greatest gift to me. We had FFMs and she said she maybe wanted an MFM. So far she had just flashed other guys and seemed to be saving her pussy for me. 

 She was always so much wetter when we played in front of others. A buddy of mine, let‚Äôs say Chris, eventually started grabbing her tits‚Ä¶only when they were alone together. She had shown herself off to guys all the time. She had fucked any girl curious enough to let her. 

I was younger and didn‚Äôt know how to communicate very well aside from getting pissed and getting in a fight with my friend. For some reason it felt like he did it behind my back. Writing this now I‚Äôm like lol yeah guy

Well, Winona thought the two of us taking off our shirts and punching each other was the hottest thing ever. Neither of us really win, though we both landed some good ones‚Ä¶ fight is like 10 seconds of animal rage and then we agreed to stop throwing hands and shake on it. We both hurt each other pretty good. Winona was on her knees immediately, pulling out my dick and grasping at Chris‚Äô crotch. She was so happy, looking up at both of us on her knees. Switching between our dicks. Making these hungry depraved sounds. Telling us how fucking wet she was seeing us beat the shit out of each other. 

It was so weird at first. Chris and I are looking at each other‚Äôs dicks. He‚Äôs never seen an uncut one before, I guess. We are like roughly the same size (I‚Äôm a lil under 7‚Äù)  but I‚Äôm thicker and yes even though I have a hot slut slobbering and spitting on my dick we are preoccupied with our fucking **dick size**. Stupid stupid men

Eventually she‚Äôs on all fours on the basement floor. I remember Stone Temple Pilots playing as I ran my fingers around her asshole and spanked her ass‚Ä¶slid my fingers in her pussy. Looking up at my friend pushing his cock in my girlfriend‚Äôs open drooling mouth. I start sliding into her, pulling out and pushing in slowly. We didn‚Äôt even‚Ä¶talk about condoms. She‚Äôs making a sloshing wet sound from both ends now. The deeper I slide my dick into her pink wet hole the more she moans on Chris‚Äô dick and then the more he grabs her hair and pushes himself into her mouth and the she sort of squirms on me and the whole thing started over. 

Winona tells us both, ‚ÄúI want to feel Chris‚Äô cock in my pussy.‚Äù She was a really filthy talker. She was asking us to use her like a set of holes, calling herself a cumslut. She would even slap **herself** in the face. I‚Äôve never had another girl do that while sucking my dick. Chris came in her pussy pretty early, probably when Winona looked back at him and started barking and panting like a dog. The first time she did that to me, I came like‚Ä¶immediately. Every time a girl ever does that for me, I think of her. So romantic, I know. 

Chris sits out for a few minutes before he can get it up again. Im trying so hard to last until he can get it back up when I realize‚Ä¶this is awesome. She‚Äôs so happy. When Chris gets back in her, he‚Äôs so rough. She‚Äôs moaning hard around my cock. She‚Äôs breathing around my dick, an amazing strained, wet sound...Her drool is sliding off her chin onto the floor. Her boobs are swinging faster and faster. We both grab one and take turns pinching a nipple‚Ä¶feeling the other‚Äôs actions through her. Taking turns fucking and cumming in her pussy and mouth as long as we could get our dicks hard. I didn‚Äôt even think about pushing my dick back in her cunt after he came in her.  She was a heaving, used up mess. Chris and I were zonked out but Winona was full of energy, telling us her favorite things we did. 

Two days later people were walking in that basement and saying, ‚ÄúWow it smells like pussy in here.‚Äù",(M)y first MFM,1.0,2.0

s3jhek,"Due to the overwhelming reaction to the news that Novak Djokovic has been denied entry to Australia to play in the opening Grand Slam event of the year, this thread is being created to serve as a placeholder to discuss anything related to it.

Any new discussion threads related to the topic, links to duplicated posts and content which isn't a significant news update to the story will be deleted. These can all go in the new thread here.

Please keep your comments civil, the subreddit rules are [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/tennis/about/rules/). If your comments break any of these rules they will be removed and may result in a ban. Repeated violations will result in a permanent ban. Please help the mod team by reporting any content you see and this will help us see things much faster. If you're interested in debating politics, there are other forums and subreddits for this which are more suitable.

This story in isolation wouldn't usually warrant the creation of a megathread. However, the gravity of the worldwide reaction and flood of new users and content means, we need now consolidate this into a single place in order to retain focus on some of the actual tennis tournaments that are taking place this week including the ATP Cup, Adelaide International, Melbourne Summer Sets and Sydney Tennis Classic.

## Match Events

Minute | Event
:--:|:--
90+9' | The referee checks his watch and blows his whistle to signal the end of this match.
90+6' | Mathias Olivera Miramontes (Getafe) will miss the next game because of that yellow card.
90+1' | Isco (Real Madrid) creates himself some space around the penalty spot and connects with the free kick. His accurate header would probably have ended up in the bottom left corner, but David Soria pulls off a decent save to thwart him.
87' | Mario Melero Lopez shows a yellow card to Casemiro (Real Madrid) for his blatant foul.
85' | Substitution. Toni Kroos is replaced by Isco (Real Madrid).
85' | The substitution has been made. Peter Gonzalez (Real Madrid) has replaced Lucas Vazquez.
83' | Quique Flores has decided to substitute Erick Cabaco and he is replaced by Allan Nyom (Getafe).
83' | Substitution. Enes Unal did his best and is replaced by Jakub Jankto (Getafe).
82' | Mauro Arambarri (Getafe) has tested the patience of referee Mario Melero Lopez and goes into the book for a previous late challenge.
74' | The substitution is prepared. Florentino (Getafe) joins the action as a substitute, replacing Carles Alena.
67' | Carlo Ancelotti prepares a substitution. Rodrygo is replaced by Mariano Diaz (Real Madrid).
65' | Substitution. Sandro Ramirez walks off the pitch and Jaime Mata (Getafe) comes on as a substitute.
56' | This yellow card was deserved. The tackle by Damian Suarez (Getafe) was quite harsh and Mario Melero Lopez didn't hesitate to show him a yellow card.
56' | Sandro Ramirez (Getafe) is unlucky with a goal-bound effort from the edge of the box. A fortuitous save from Thibaut Courtois stops the ball from going into the middle of the goal.
46' | The need to improve in the second half has brought about a change. Marco Asensio (Real Madrid) comes off for Eden Hazard.
46' | Half-time substitution. Carlo Ancelotti decided to make a change. Ferland Mendy is replaced by  Marcelo (Real Madrid).
46' | The second half has just started.
45+3' | That is it for the first half after the referee blows his whistle and the players head to their respective dressing rooms.
41' | Carlo Ancelotti appears to have said too much and referee Mario Melero Lopez comes over and theatrically shows him a yellow card.
21' | The referee shows the yellow card to Rodrygo (Real Madrid).
20' | Lucas Vazquez dinks a lofted pass into the path of Toni Kroos (Real Madrid) inside the box, but his drive sails just over the crossbar. The ball goes out of play and Getafe will have a goal kick.
18' | Luka Modric (Real Madrid) latches on to a sweet pass on the edge of the box and unleashes a brilliant shot towards the goal, but he hits the crossbar!
16' | Great touch by Luka Modric (Real Madrid) as he receives a precise pass deep inside the box and rips a shot goalwards, but the keeper pulls off an amazing save! The ball goes behind for a corner. Real Madrid will have an opportunity to threaten the opposition's goal.
9' | Enes Unal (Getafe) receives the ball after one of the defenders fails to make a clearance and sends the ball into the back of the net!
1' | Today's match has just started, enjoy the game!

sbp44g,"My first foursome. Three guys. One was my husband. One his brother. One his brothers friend.

We went to my room and undressed. I made out with all three as they surrounded me, cocks pressed up against me, hands squeezing by breasts and ass, fingers rubbing my vagina and penetrating my pussy and ass. I broke up the session and got out the lube. I held it up and asked the boys what the plan was. After looking at their cocks I pointed to the first, the largest of the three and told him to go lay on the bed horizontally. I told the second guy, my husband, but who also happened to have the smallest penis, to go by the other guys feet. And the third to go by the first guys head. I climbed into the bed and mounted him. I then handed the lube to my husband. He lubed up and put his cock in my ass. I then told the last guy to put his cock in my mouth. For that moment, all my holes were full and I had reached full slut. Then it got awkward. The guy below complained about having the first guys balls dangling above his face. Whenever we tried to fuck, one of the cocks would slide out or the last guy would accidently shove it in my mouth too far and chock me. I told them to stop. We got off the bed and I said two guys can Chinese finger lock me (vagina and mouth) and my husband can watch and have my ass when they're done. This plan worked much better. When they were all done, they got dressed and went back downstairs. I was left on my back, covered in cum - on my face, in my mouth, on my neck, breast, and stomach, dropping out of my ass, on my hands and even on my feet (though I'm not sure how it got there). I showered, put on a bra and thong, threw a robe over that, and went downstairs with everyone else for the rest of the night.",28f takes three cocks,1.0,2.0

Rastien station looked a lot like home. A single Rasputin dreadnought was hovering below the station as Laskian ships drifted from it to the close by asteroid ring, it was positioned so close that FTL wasn't even necessary for the short hop to the mineral rich ring system.

I watched for a moment as Rasputin piloted the Traveller close before grabbing the controls. Almost immediately the lattice of energy dissipates from the control panels and I have full control of my ship again. ‚ÄúThanks big guy.‚Äù I say as I go over the systems, more out of habit than anything else.

Before I can finish my round of checks a com‚Äôs request comes in. I answer it after a moment. ‚ÄúThis is Rastien station security, Unknown vessel Identify yourself.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is the independent starship Traveller.‚Äù I start to explain but the man on the other end of the line cuts me off.

‚ÄúI can read your IFF, who are you? Ship design matches the warship orbiting the station.‚Äù he says.

‚ÄúYou missed out the part where you‚Äôll fire on me if I don't comply.‚Äù I tell him.

There's a snort from the audio feed ‚ÄúI happen to have a brain. I don't make threats that I can't follow up on.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood, Im Reiss. You might notice there‚Äôs a new planet in the system close to the star.‚Äù I say.

‚Äú...I need to send this up the chain.‚Äù he says a moment later.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve got some time.‚Äù I reply.

The line goes silent for a moment before a request for a video feed pops up. I accept and came face to face with a Laskian security officer. He stares at my face before cursing quietly. ‚ÄúSorry ma‚Äôam. Miss? I was following protocol you understand.‚Äù he babbles.

‚ÄúRelax, I just want to dock somewhere and get a few days quiet RnR. moving a planet is knackering.‚Äù I joke before I realise that's just the sort of thing I might not want to say to calm someone down.

‚ÄúRight. Umm. I have an empty bay on the other side of the station. Bay 8, you can dock there. I‚Äôll log the ship name but not your own.‚Äù he says.

‚ÄúI wouldn't bother. I'm fairly‚Ä¶distinctive.‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúJust don't go announcing it to the entire station.‚Äù I ask.

He nods and types away at the system whilst I tease the ship on a new course towards the docking bay. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre cleared to dock. Bay is open and waiting. Ma‚Äôam I have to ask. Where you sent by the Tribunal to save us?‚Äù he asks.

I frown then remember that some stations have a strong presence of the laskian religion. Rastien must be one of them. ‚ÄúNo one sent me. If anything I‚Äôve been dragged around through most of this.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf the Tribunal didnt send you then how could you have done what you‚Äôve done.‚Äù he asks.

‚ÄúI had help.‚Äù I tell him seriously. ‚ÄúEvery step of the way I had great people standing besides me. No one does this alone. The only difference between me one year ago and you right now is I'm a woman.‚Äù I tell him seriously.

‚ÄúBut they say you‚Äôre immortal, that you had your head cut clean off and then healed yourself like it was nothing.‚Äù he says.

I nod. ‚ÄúI can do that. Not that it's pleasant. If you want to learn more I suggest asking one of the mercenaries that work under me, or people from the fleet. Anyone who calls themselves Riiswalker.‚Äù I say.

‚ÄúLike Mary the r‚Ä¶Riiswalker.‚Äù He corrects himself. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs on the station right now.‚Äù he explains.

‚ÄúI should meet up with her soon.‚Äù I say finally arriving at the bay. It could easily hold my relatively small ship in its birth. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got to dock this ship now. If we meet again feel free to talk.‚Äù I say cutting the call so I can focus on docking the ship.

Less than a minute later the automated clamps settle onto the Traveller, locking it in place as the hangar bay doors close and a docking tube extends out to the Traveller‚Äôs airlock. No atmospheric hangars here apparently. I shut down the ship's reactor and get ready to leave, collecting my personal engrams and a few backup guns before cycling the airlock and walking down the tube into the station.

‚ÄúIt might be very busy here‚Äù I say to Imperious.

‚ÄúAnd?‚Äù he asks, crawling out of my back and settling on my shoulder again, his tail twisting around my upper arm to anchor him in place.

‚ÄúWell you‚Äôre quite small right now.‚Äù I say.

‚ÄúYou forget I choose to be this small to be close to you O Reiss mine,‚Äù he says. A moment later he adds. ‚ÄúIt might scare the prey if I was walking behind you in my new normal size.‚Äù

I chuckle at the thought before we‚Äôre stopped by a security gate. An officer quickly scans me after staring at Imperious for a moment and opens the gate for me. ‚ÄúWelcome to Restian station. May the‚Ä¶Tribunal bless, you?‚Äù the woman says, turning the phrase into a question at the end.

I nod and flick a mist of light over her. ‚ÄúAnd may you go with mine.‚Äù I say trying not the chuckle at the absurd situation.

‚ÄúAm I a god?‚Äù I ask Imperious.

‚ÄúWhats a god?‚Äù he asks, sniffing the air and looking around the small corridors of the station exterior.

I consider how to reply as we go through the last door to the station proper. ‚ÄúMaster. Welcome to Restian station.‚Äù Mary says kneeling at the head of an honour guard of mercenaries all standing to attention.

‚ÄúMary? How did you know I was coming?‚Äù I ask.

‚ÄúI recognised the Traveller and came as soon as possible.‚Äù She replies still facing the floor.

‚ÄúMary stand up. You‚Äôre my friend first.‚Äù I say to her. She climbs to her feet and looks at me a hint of tears filling her eyes before she notices Imperious.

‚ÄúMary, Imperious, its a bit of a story.‚Äù I say.

‚ÄúI see. What do you need me to do?‚Äù She asks.

‚ÄúMary‚Ä¶‚Äù I start to complain but cut myself off. ‚ÄúFirst off I don't need an honour guard.‚Äù I say to her before facing the assembled mercs. ‚ÄúIt's good to see you all but if you have somewhere to be please don't hang around on my account.‚Äù I tell them.

They relax and smile, the professional facade they‚Äôd put up crumbling away. A few filter off before Mary snaps at them. ‚ÄúYou heard her, the lot of you fuck off. Find something to do. Go portal to the fleet and help out with the next station or something.‚Äù she shouts and the mercenaries all run off, one slicing open a portal which half of them flee through.

Then it's just the four of us. Me, Mary, Michael and Imperious, in the square. ‚ÄúHow‚Äôs the station?‚Äù I ask, picking a lane and starting to walk down it mingling into the few people going about their business.

‚ÄúThe people are tense. Judgments are preaching in the streets, half of them think you‚Äôre the spawn of Discord sent to damn us all whilst the other half see you as some apostle of the tribunal. Honestly I think they keep swapping opinions too.‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúThe less religious here are trying to figure out what‚Äôs changed. Obviously the miners don't know what rocks to start breaking into and the machine mind isn't helping. The rich cunts are talking about rationing supplies and the station security are scared witless.‚Äù she says walking with me.

‚ÄúThe underbelly is riled up. With no outside gangers and gutter mercs are pushing each other.‚Äù Michael adds.

‚ÄúWhat concern of ours is that?‚Äù Mary asks him.

‚ÄúWe could move in, clean it up. Lots of laskians under the city no one cares for. It's easy power and the station will thank us for it.‚Äù Michael says.

‚ÄúNo, they‚Äôre on the first ship's planetside. There‚Äôs a dozen places in this system they can go to. Hot, cold, garden or desert.‚Äù I say. Michael nods and falls back again.

‚ÄúHe never spoke up like that before.‚Äù I note.

Mary smiles briefly and looks away. I feel my cheeks hit my eyes as I smile. ‚ÄúGood.‚Äù I say after a moment.

‚ÄúMARY!‚Äù Someone calls from up ahead, 

‚ÄúNot this cunt.‚Äù She growls, turning to move down a side road.

‚ÄúWait. Who is he?‚Äù I ask as the man strides towards us.

‚ÄúA Justice of the Tribunal. And a chair of the station‚Äôs council.‚Äù Michael replies. 

‚ÄúMary and Michael just the two I‚Äôve been looking for!‚Äù the man says, striding towards us. He looks at me and then to Mary. ‚ÄúWhen I heard every one of your men was running through the city like the Discords demons were at their heels. May I ask who you are miss?‚Äù

I hold out a hand. ‚ÄúReiss.‚Äù I Introduce myself.

He goes to take my hand before staring at the stars under my skin. ‚ÄúSo it's true.‚Äù he whispers. ‚ÄúYou are marked by the tribunal.‚Äù he says looking into my eyes and then at Imperious glaring at him from my shoulder. ‚ÄúIn more than one way.‚Äù he notes.

‚ÄúI, am, marked.‚Äù I say, emphasising each word separately. ‚ÄúBy my power, no council of dead ancestors gave me my power. It was earned, not given.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere is no power greater than the tribune, they dictate the laws of the universe. If they did not give you the power to save us where did it come from?‚Äù he asks, twisting my hand gently to see the stars beneath my skin from a different angle.

‚ÄúThe light, the dark, and old god who came before them both.‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúNow if you don't mind, I'm a few hours from waking up on a planet I warped here. I‚Äôd like to find somewhere to get a good meal and a tall drink.‚Äù I say nodding to Mary. we start walking again but instead letting us pass the man blocks my way.

‚ÄúThe thing is.‚Äù He starts but I just blink through him and continue walking.

Mary and Michael chase after me. ‚ÄúThat was well worth it.‚Äù Mary says as we round a corner the Justice shouting after us.

‚ÄúYou know somewhere we can get something to eat?‚Äù I ask.

‚ÄúMmm somewhere with meat.‚Äù Imperious asks.

‚ÄúOh you talk.‚Äù Mary notes.

Imperious doesn't reply, opting instead to vanish into glimmer. Mary shrugs and with a single motion draws her sword, swings it and opens a portal for us. I climb through finding myself in a dark and smelly bar with a few mercs nursing beers on their tables all staring at me.

‚ÄúRelax assholes she‚Äôs my boss.‚Äù Mary says walking through, after Michael walks through the portal slams closed. 

Looking around i'm in a greasy rundown bar under the city, its built into a junction of the undercity‚Äôs pipeworks, lit by neon gas tubing bathing the place in purple light, two sides of the place were open to the undercity but this wasn't a problem, people down here were either hiding from authority or keeping out of their way. That meant gangsters, criminals and mercenaries, honest people when compared to priests and politicians.

The few groups sitting at their tables have all stopped their conversations to stare at me. ‚ÄúSo are those actual stars or just some kind of subdermal decoration?‚Äù the barman asks breaking the silence.

I look at the man and he stares back, his hands working automatically with a cocktail mixer four glasses in front of him. ‚ÄúSo are we gonna stare at eachother like lovebirds or are you taking a seat and getting a drink?‚Äù I asks holding up the prepared mystery drink.

I smile and take a seat at the bar Mary and Michael join me and in short order three cocktails and one glass of fizz are poured out, Michael takes the fizz and slinks into a corner to keep watch. Whilst i examine the drink as the different colours swirl around inside it. Mary picks hers up and takes a swig sighing before screwing her face up. ‚ÄúYou made it a sour chaser this time.‚Äù she complains.

‚ÄúPersonal special, not every day Mary the fucking red‚Äôs boss comes walking through my door.‚Äù he says turning back to me. ‚ÄúCall me Cap‚Äô everyone else does. Used to fly Mary around for a few years. Now im a humble barman trading old stories for new gossip. And you. You‚Äôre talk of the station.‚Äù he says taking a sip of his own drink.

I nod and pick up my own drink, the first thing that hits me is a burst of spicy heat, then the smooth alcohol and sweet fruits flow over my tongue, when I swallow it my throat tightens up as a wash of sour flavour hits the back of my tongue. ‚ÄúWow‚Äù I say taking another sip and enjoying the mix.

‚ÄúSo like I asked before, there‚Äôs a running bet on if the stars and eyes are implants or something else.‚Äù he asks.

‚ÄúNo implants.‚Äù I say, ‚Äúif you want I can show you my party trick.‚Äù I add.

‚ÄúWhats that?‚Äù he asks. ‚ÄúAlso now owe a mate 100 credits.‚Äù

I slide my stool back a bit and lay my arm on the table. ‚ÄúYou don't mind a bit of blood on the bartop do you?‚Äù I ask.

‚ÄúNot exactly but what are you going to do?‚Äù he asks.

I turn to Mary who downs her drink then chops my arm with her hand, soulfire slices through flesh and bone and then my severed arm is there on the table. After the shock and pain passes slightly I turn and show my stump to the rest of the bar, picking my arm with my other hand and waving it around.

It's funny how heavy a limb is when it's not attached to you. The stars were still flowing underneath the skin of the severed limb though. ‚ÄúThere you have it, no implants.‚Äù I say ‚ÄúImperious.‚Äù

‚ÄúCan i eat that?‚Äù he asks climbing out and sniffing my arm before pulsing with light, as the light washes over my the limb vanishes and reappears where it belongs. ‚ÄúDamnit.‚Äù he complains.

Cap and the rest of the bar are silent as Imperious clacks along the bar top sniffing at drinks.

‚ÄúSo what else are you going to throw at me?‚Äù he asks after we watch Imperious for a moment.

‚ÄúIf he chooses he can become the size of this station.‚Äù I say causing Imperious to look back at me, I can feel his amusement radiating through our link as he makes his way back and settles down on the bar top next to me. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs also a wish dragon.‚Äù I say.

‚ÄúLike the kid stories, about the spirit in a jar that gives you what you want.‚Äù Cap says.

‚ÄúAnd then twists it so it's hollow and disappointing, yep.‚Äù I finish for him. ‚ÄúSo don't go wishing for a million credits. They're probably stolen.‚Äù I tell him.

Cap and Mary grunt and take another sip of their drinks. ‚ÄúSo you didnt just come here for my company, what can I do for you?‚Äù he asks. ‚ÄúYou look like you could use a decent meal.‚Äù

I nod and he brings me a tablet with a menu on it. All of it is standard pre packed meals but these ones need a specialised cooking unit to prepare them before being served. I pick out one I like the look of then another for Imperious which is mostly synthetic meat proteins.

‚ÄúOn its way miss.‚Äù cap says walking into a back room.

‚ÄúSo last I felt was a rush of power. Did you kill a dragon?‚Äù Mary asks.

‚ÄúActually No, that was Imperious granting me a very powerful wish for a moment.‚Äù I say before explaining what happened on the planet.

‚ÄúSo This Nepp. Are they like us now, me and the others?‚Äù She asks.


‚ÄúWhat do you mean? Bound to me? Not as far as I can tell. I guess the light she‚Äôs got came from me but I gave it to her freely. I didn't expect anything back which is why it worked I suspect. She‚Äôs a good person, and a good friend.‚Äù I say.

‚ÄúYou trust her?‚Äù Mary asks.

‚ÄúI do, she saved my life several times when it would have been in her interests not to.‚Äù I say.

Mary shakes her head. ‚ÄúI don't understand it but then again I‚Äôm‚Ä¶‚Äù she trails off as Cap returns with two plates of steaming hot food. He places both in front of me and I push one towards Imperious who sniffs the large pile of mince and potatoes before shoving his head into the pile and taking large chomping bites.

‚ÄúGood.‚Äù he says after a few mouthfulls.

We all watch him devour his food as I pick up the burrito filled with flavoured proteins and strips of synthetic meats enjoying the grease dripping dish. ‚ÄúSo how are you and Michael getting on?‚Äù Cap asks.

‚ÄúI dont know.‚Äù Mary replies. ‚ÄúI tried to cut his arm off yesterday.‚Äù she says.

‚ÄúDid he mind?‚Äù Cap asks.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs still here. So I guess not?‚Äù Mary replies.

‚ÄúWell if you can pull of a party trick like Reiss just did I suppose a little violence in the bedroom doesn't matter. Glad you two are getting along.‚Äù

‚ÄúSpeaking off, Reiss there‚Äôs an issue. Ricky was raping whores and, infecting them with soulfire. They‚Äôre in the throne getting medical aid right now, but it's not looking good.‚Äù Mary tells me.

I nod. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll see what I can do, shall we go now and do we have a portal to the throne on the station?‚Äù I ask her.

‚ÄúIt can wait a bit. They‚Äôre whores not fighters.‚Äù Mary says.

I shake my head at her response. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll finish my meal and then we‚Äôre heading there.‚Äù I tell her and she nods accepting my order. I felt a little guilty about giving her an order but knew her enough to know that she genuinely did not value their lives as much as her mercenaries or the people of the navy. They just aren't as important to her.

Imperious in the meantime is licking up the remains of his meal having left most of the vegetable substitute in favour of the meat.

My burrito was at the stage where it's easier to let it disintegrate and eat it piecemeal so I let it collapse on the plate before spooning the remains up and shoving the plate away.

As much as I‚Äôd like to spend the next 20 hours in bed life doesn't seem to be working that way so I drain the last of the drink screwing my face up at the sour chaser before nodding to Mary. Michael takes the lead as we leave the bar Imperious jumping onto my shoulder",Snow Chapter 71,2.0,2.0

""Teabagging the killer is a dick move and I wish crouching slowed you down for a second"". ""OH YEAH, WELL FACECAMPING IS TOO SO THERE TEABAGGING IS FINE UNTIL IT IS REMOVED""

""Survivors shouldn't be able to choose the map because there are far too many survivor sided maps and not enough killer ones in the game right now for that to be fair"". ""KILLERS CAN CHOOSE THE MAP TOO, ALL THREE MAPS THAT ACTUALLY FAVOR THEM IN ANY WAY, GIT GUD""

""Good Nurses have no counterplay and probably need a rework"" ""OH YEAH WELL THEN SURVIVORS ARENT ALLOWED TO USE CIRCLE OF HEALING.""

&#x200B;

""SWF is way too strong for how the game is currently balanced"" ""THEN KILLERS CAN'T TUNNEL""

&#x200B;

It's fucking exhausting. These aren't arguments, these are separate grievances. You all act like everyone is out to get you and it stifles any decent arguments because you're angry about something that has absolutely nothing to do with the situation.

&#x200B;

If you want to be mad, by all means, the game gives you plenty of reasons to be mad, because it's designed like someone asked a twelve year old what's balanced and then rolled that same 12 year old's head across a keyboard, and it only gets by on licenses and a lack of competition, but stop trying to say that, because you're annoyed, someone else isn't allowed to be annoyed.

It sucks that we have to watch the media coverage of him that we didn‚Äôt get to enjoy while he was here. Overall, it‚Äôs painful and it‚Äôs okay for you to feel that way.

However, there is something to be said about remaining positive. The Lions weren‚Äôt going to win with him and the trade remains the right move. I fully believe in this front office and coaching staff. The future is very bright.

rxgfv9,"I live in a major metropolitan area in the US, and I was doing my normal morning commute. The norm here is that people stand to the right on escalators and walk to the left. I passed a man at the end of the escalator (leaving plenty of room), and as soon as he got off, he came up to me, looked me directly in the eye, and gave me the middle finger while calling me a stuck up b*tch. I was on a work call at the time, and I really hope that my majority-male office didn‚Äôt hear that in the background. Also, I consider myself lucky that he left me alone after that and walked in the opposite direction. The dude wasn‚Äôt big, but I‚Äôm tiny, and he definitely could have pushed me around if he wanted. 

To be honest, it‚Äôs not so much the language that he used that bothers me. Sure, being seen as a less than human b*tch hurts, but I‚Äôve heard that word so many times now, that it doesn‚Äôt sting anymore. Instead, what hurts is how powerless I felt during this whole interaction. It was a reminder that I‚Äôm not safe just existing in public ‚Äì that I have to live at the mercy of the others. 

Thanks to this sh*thead, I spent the rest of my commute super paranoid. I felt a jolt of adrenaline every time I spotted someone who resembled him, and I was constantly looking over my shoulder. I‚Äôll probably spend the next month thinking twice about passing men. I‚Äôm young now, and while I recognize that this event isn‚Äôt as traumatic as the worst forms of gendered violence, I‚Äôm sure the chronic stress will add up over a lifetime. I already struggle with anxiety, so my health will definitely suffer for it. And every time I start to feel safe again, something like this happens and pulls the rug out from under me. I‚Äôm starting to think that I will never be safe. 

And worst of all? There‚Äôs no way to hold him (or any of the men who do this) accountable. They get to walk away without any consequences. Meanwhile, I‚Äôm here just struggling to exist in peace.","Today, I got called a ‚Äústuck up b*tch‚Äù for having the audacity to pass a man on the subway",2.0,2.0

It's been a month since I started parking at my designated spot and I've been charging my car everyday (I keep it plugged in at all times).

I am the only one with an EV here so around me are all ICE cars.

As I was about to drive away, I met my neighbor who parks beside me and she was asking if the electricity I am using for my car was coming out of my own bill. Up to this point, I really didn't make a big deal of it as I have my bill set up for automatic monthly payments and never check it. I am really paying pocket money for electricity anyway (like $15-40/month).

And then she went on to say how they were also wondering if the outdoor lighting in the parking lot was coming out of their pocket as well, and so on. She was being kinda passive aggressive and saying how if their bills go up because of this she knows where I live and she'll be knocking on my door lol. She was explaining to me how condo utility bills are split up among tenants. If she were to contribute to my EV charging, it would be a few cents per month, which I would be more than happy to pay her back.

s8s6dn,"Hello!

For those who like to remember things, remember last week? The boys made a toothbrush that looked like a big ol' poo. Here's hoping they make a mint chocolate drink this week to complete the brown/green theme. We'll see.

After the *travesty* firing last week where Aaron somehow avoided the sack I thought I'd look into the business ideas for the lads who got sacked so far. Conclusion: shit business ideas which meant they'd never have been hired at the end, so SurLordAlunSugar binned them off early. Aaron must have something that could make him some money.

Harry: Bath bombs for kids where 20% of the profits were given to children's charities. Nice idea, crowded market, no real profit. Binned.

Connor: Mobile bar in a horsebox on the back of his Land Rover. That was literally it. Bin.

Enjoy this week!

sejv6x,"this post is about simulating and causing disease. 

i started feigning illness at the age of 11, when i ended up in the hospital for the last time in an ambulance. then i had the first fainting in my life. my mother bought me a lot of books so that i would be a little happy and my condition would improve at least a little. i stayed in the department for 2 weeks and was discharged home without a diagnosis. these 2 weeks were a time of calm. i didn't think about anything. i just lay in the ward, met a girl who had serious stomach problems, and realized that i like being in the hospital. i liked it so much when i was called for procedures or tests, when i had to go across the street to another building for examinations, etc. i just felt good, even very good, despite the weakness due to an obscure illness. since then i realized how important it was for me to be in the hospital.

and i started feigning. i lied that my head hurts, that i fainted again while my mother was at work in order to get to the hospital for further examination. but none of that worked. the maximum that i got was taking pills at home for a month, accumulated a bunch of unfinished tasks at school and notably spoiled my mental state. in short, nothing good.

then i began to realize that in order for you to be believed, you need evidence in the form of bad tests, ultrasound results, and so on. then for the first time i examined the home first aid kit, namely the dosages of drugs and the consequences of overdoses. but for a long time i did not dare to take them. but then i realized that the worse, the better. therefore,i started with a slight excess of a single dose of paracetamol (acetaminophen) 3 times a day (taking a total of 4.5 grams per day). and then, after reading that the larger the single dose, the worse, i decided to take 10-14 tablets once a day. now i keep doing it. recently, a doctor i went to with complaints of weakness and drowsiness told me to go to a psychiatrist. i didn't even know what to say to her.

i just want to ask if this is ok. i can't figure it out myself.

thanks for reading this to the end. it was important for me to share my story with someone. unfortunately, i don't have a person who i can talk to about my problems. thank you. hope you're ok.

ry4pkv,"Hey all, interesting question I would say because to me it was very unusual and I would like some advice on how to understand and make the best of this situation. It's a hairy situation.

I'm a very sexual female and I have been in many relationships before. Very open and always communicative about it too. Married this great guy a few years ago. Fact is, I always shaved completely down stairs. It started when I was young and some guys asked for it and I liked the ""clean"" sensation it made me feel. And I've been doing so for a long time, almost like a no brainer. 

.... Until recently husband asked for me to not do it, and leave it as hairy as possible. Like, no trim whatsoever. Never. Welcome to the jungle situation. At first I was like, no big deal, lets go. Then it started becoming really big, hairy, full bush situation. And it started making me a bit uncomfortable.

Now you ask, where is advice needed? Well, I want to make him happy and this request is not a problem to me. In fact, I've started to like the practical side of it - waxing hurts and itches a lot, and it takes a lot of effort, bi-weekly basis. But I've felt way less confidant in our sex moments. I don't get to enjoy much oral anymore, and every time he goes close, I feel this anxiety. In my brain, it's smelly, not good looking, etc etc. I obviously shower and have everything good to go, but my brain blocks me because it's too hairy, it's impossible for him to be enjoying that. Right?

I communicate a lot and told him all this, and the answer is: this is the best I ever had, please do not touch it and let it grow. Which boosts me up a bit, but still, I don't feel in my sexiest of times. I guess I got complimented too much for being a bare, pinky, petite, that now I can't enjoy being a bit more natural in there. 

Anyone got any advice or lived something similar? How can I unblock this on my brain and leave it be? Is he really enjoying it or now just saying this to make me comfortable and not hinder my confidence (it's a possibility since he's the one that does not communicate very well and sometimes just move's on to avoid making me uncomfortable)? Anyone living happily ever after with a big natural bush there?

s8670f,"I (28M) have been with my wife, Rebecca, (29F) for four years. Rebecca comes from a very religious family and we have hidden a lot of aspects about our marriage. We have some contact with them and only see them on holidays and special occasions, like weddings or baby showers. One of the biggest things they disapprove of was not having our wedding in a church, it was such a big deal that we now hide aspects of our marriage, like the fact we are going to be childfree

One thing the family does not know about is that Rebecca and I have an open marriage and have had an open relationship ever since we started dating. So I was meeting up with another girl at the bar a few days ago. It was going well and I didn‚Äôt notice anything strange. Well, today we went to Rebecca‚Äôs sister‚Äôs ‚Äúbaby shower‚Äù ( the large baby shower was canceled since the plague so it really was dinner with her family). We get there and everyone is glaring daggers at me. The whole thing is tense until we get to a slideshow on her sister showing pictures of the nursery and other baby stuff. In the slide show, there was a picture of me with the girl at the bar. It wasn‚Äôt an innocent picture and looking at it everyone would think I was cheating. 

The whole family starts yelling at me and calling me a cheater and how dare I do this to Rebecca. I look at Rebecca for help but she just stays quiet. I try to get them to calm down but nothing is working. So I just yell out Rebecca and I have an open marriage. This causes everyone to start freaking out even more and we quickly leave.

I‚Äôm in the car with Rebecca and she starts to yell at me about how could I tell her family that. That I completely betrayed her trust and this is probably going to ruin her relationship with the family. I‚Äôm angry now and say, ‚Äú So what, you would rather make me out to be a cheater than tell the truth.‚Äù  The argument continues for the rest of the car ride and she won‚Äôt talk to me anymore.

I'm trying to understand how it works in the UK. Is 'bon appetit' common? Or phrases like 'dig in' or 'enjoy'? Or do you just usually say 'Mmm it looks delicious'. Or if something is said, then who usually says that - the cook or it doesn't matter?",What do you say before a meal?,2.0,2.0
861xkx,"So the Mike-Rachel-Logan plotline really annoyed me the first time I watched Suits, and now I'm on my second viewing I want to express my rage in words. Ordinarily, I really like Rachel, but here I feel like she's a bit of a selfish, unpleasant person. 

My first issue is that the whole thing seems extremely out of character for Rachel. I just can't see her ever seeing anything in Logan. Let me explain. I would consider Rachel, on the whole, to be a 'nice person' (her humouring of and concern for Harold, her kindness to Louis, her general predisposition for doing the right thing e.g. Mikado). Logan, on the other hand, is very clearly a 'not nice person' (greedy investor, total disregard for the jobs and livelihoods of his future employees, always gets his own way, is manipulative, cheats on his wife, puts Rachel down for being a paralegal). Very little of the alleged 'chemistry' between Rachel and Logan is shown, and so overall I'm left totally baffled as to what she sees in him. To me it seems highly improbable that she'd ever be attracted to someone so demonstrably unpleasant, with no redeeming characteristics, in the first place.

Moreover, after he reappears as a client, I don't understand why she doesn't tell him to roundly fuck off and that's that. After all, he insulted her by saying she's ""just a paralegal"" behind her back and she turned up at his home, causing him to be rumbled by his wife, so you'd expect significant bad blood between them. But no. She's very receptive to working with him, and even seems to enjoy it, despite the fact that his intentions are literally to fuck over her boyfriend (and then fuck her). She has SO MANY opportunities to tell him to leave her alone, and yet she doesn't, and repeatedly shows up at his home/office. You'd be lucky to get me and an ex in a room together voluntarily, unless I thought there'd be a chance for us to have it off again. So really her betrayal of Mike started long before she kissed Logan, it started when she didn't immediately and explicitly reject his advances and insist he went through Harvey for business related matters. Again, when she was in his flat and he leaned in the first time, surely she should've slapped him in the face and walked out instead of going along with it until the last second. In short: she wanted something to happen and wasn't a passive victim of his advances - she was an active participant. 

Finally, and this is the bit that I really hate, more than the other bits, cause I get that they were plotlines whereas this is just poor writing: after she completely voluntarily kisses Logan, keeps it from Mike for a week and then tells him, she seems to be under the impression that her biggest mistake was not telling him for so long, whereas in reality it was the fact that she cheated on Mike in the first place. She never seems to confront the fact that she is entirely in the wrong, and take responsibility for it. Meanwhile, Donna encourages her to cover it up which to me seems most out of character and totally the wrong call. Rachel never properly apologises for the fact that she cheated on Mike, and then makes out that he's in the wrong for not forgiving her. What the actual fuck? Mike went easy on her considering - if I was him, I would've kicked her out of MY house, not left myself and let her stay. And then in the end, Mike decides to forgive Rachel. What did she do to deserve it? Nothing. What did she do to win him back? Nothing. What were the consequences of her actions? Nothing. She fucked up, didn't take responsibility, tried to turn it around on Mike, and then at the end everything went back to normal as if it never happened. I like Rachel on the whole, but here her character was really screwed over by the writers and it was entirely inconsistent with the rest of her character.

Am I right here, or is my male-bias clouding my judgement and does this sound like a misogynistic rant?

Turns out they gave me trauma. I thought they were the hero of the book. Turns out they're the villian. But like I didn't know. I just had to keep turning pages.

Characters that were my favorite, it turns out, where orphan torturers in the beginning of the book! I'm like ""I just thought they were spicy!""

I thought this was a comedy, but oh shit. Goes from page 105 to 104... it's a drama!

But fr I'm constantly remembering things and making sense of the world. I'm on page 104 and like ""ohhhh that's related to page 356 I had no ideaa""

I probably wouldn't have enjoyed the book if I read it normally though. It's turning out to be a pretty sad story. I wouldn't have normally chosen this. My library keeps surprising me

s0g6gm,"Seriously. Even if the show doesn't have any political connotations, if the main character isn't a white guy, it will be regarded as ""woke"" pandering and political. The term ""woke"" has completely lost all meaning. It's now just a word people use to greenlight¬†their prejudice. Not every film starring a non-white male lead is ""woke."" Shang chi isn't ""woke"".¬† It had no political undertones, the characters were genuine and entertaining, but because of its cast, [every youtube movie reviewer and their mother wished for its demise](https://preview.redd.it/kb771k8sowl71.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=65fafaf7dca1cc25739afc48748bf961fbf1d00e), and all of the talking points in their videos revolved on the idea that it was ""woke.""

There are plenty of other examples, but the point is that,¬†no matter how good or bad the program is, these people will always perceive the existence of minorities or women as political, and will dismiss any type of media that features them as ""woke"" pandering. Since identity politics is such a touchy subject nowadays, reducing characters you don't like to their identities by calling them woke, even if the program doesn't focus on their identity, is a definite method to ensure hatred for any form of representation they do not like

Like nerdrotic who claimed that the MCU is woke now because there's too much female representation or [that shows like hawkeye are ""woke""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qT0Svrp1wzc)   because the woman takes center stage and is a Mary Sue, which are the furthest things from the truth given that there are significantly less female leads than there are¬†male leads¬†and that Kate is one of the furthest things from a perfect character penned. 

[Or that spiderman did great at the box office because it had no ""woke"" elements](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdRuWDWtvPA) and totally not because its one of the highest grossing IPs of all time

Or criticaldrinker, who believes if women aren't written and designed to give the audience boners, then they are [""defeminizing""](https://i.redd.it/35qncy7qeu971.jpg) them and are pandering to a ""woke"" agenda. 

Youtube, in particular is dominated by people like this, who have swarms of followers who are all filled with misguided rage about matters that aren't even legitimate, that¬†are purely intended to harm minorities. It's come to the point where anything as basic as two people of different races and genders being present in the same space is enough to [set folks off](https://preview.redd.it/ty4diuh1joa81.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=9d6edbe110fd614af14756679f87fdd5a5b7ba52) like it's the 1960s when star trek showed a black woman with a white man or something. As a black guy, I aspire to be one of these actors, able to play and represent their favorite fictional character, yet the prospect of my own existence being condemned due to forces beyond my control or people deeming it ""political"" just makes me not want to exist in these spaces at all.","Stop using the term ""woke"" to describe anything involving minorities.",2.0,2.0

I walked in to pick up my online order. There was a line out the door for online order 


Turned out they were 11 orders behind. They were so behind that at one point there were no finished orders available for pick up 


I could only imagine how difficult it was to work under this kind of pressure, and have endless customers coming up to you checking their orders or directly asking you how long it was going to take. Granted none of them were rude but still. 


I also could imagine just how shitty it was when a customer or two joked that their order was promised at this time and they should just get ready to wait for an hour. Not helping bro. 


My order eventually was finished. I tried to thank the workers but no one heard me. Reading this subreddit and from my own personal experience I can guess that they were probably short staffed to the crazy level

se67gh,"You may recall I was the guy who had problems with Tesla delivery. They didn't budge or accommodate me for their blunder.  I had to wait a month for their mistake. 

What I have is the Model 3 LR. I come from driving a BMW 328i and 430i for the last decade so that's generally what I compare this car to. I had also been driving an Altima recently while waiting for the Tesla so it's nice to compare that as well. 


Styling:

PROS:
- The styling borrows from Porsche on the front end and I like that. But from other angles it looks like a regular ass sedan and I don't like that. Overall I think it's sexy but in a ""I have a family"" kind of way. I prefer the look of the old bmw 4 series more. But with the new 4 series having the buckteeth, I think I prefer the model 3. 
- Tesla people talk about panel gaps and all that. In the videos I've seen they take out a ruler and find pretty minuscule differences that I honestly would never have noticed. On delivery I eyeballed everything to make sure it was ok and it was. I have never inspected the panels of any of the previous cars I've driven but this seems about the same. 
- The interior is a different definition of luxury and the minimalism is nice, but definitely has drawbacks. 
- The all glass roof brings in a lot of light and I love that. 
- The leather feels great. Heated steering wheel and seats are great. 


CONS:
- The interior has a lot of plastic and fake wood. I don't like that - especially not in a car this expensive. 
- The back end of the car is borrows styling from Kim Kardashian in that it is a bit bloated. It doesn't interfere with vision when reversing but it does make me nervous sometimes. 

Safety:

Pros:
- The model 3 has received a 5 star rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. 
- It has collision warning systems which seem to be pretty good. It can sense concrete lips from the sidewalk which my old 4 series couldn't.
- The autopilot feature works well.

Cons:

- When reversing there is a rear view camera and also cameras for the side view. The cameras from the side view have some issues. 1. The color warmth isn't the same between all three cameras and it looks a bit janky. 2.  Compared to the birds eye view that modern cars, have when reversing and parking, the birds eye view is a lot better. 
- The lack of a blind spot indicator is so appalling that in my opinion it should be illegal. The Tesla apologists will say that the virtual car indicator on the screen is a good substitute for blind spot monitoring. This is a dumb take and typical Tesla fanboyism. Firstly, the virtual car indicator is not that accurate. I'm not betting my life on something that isn't 100 percent accurate all the time. Secondly, the screen placement means that when checking your blind spot on the left you need to look left then check the screen to the right and then look left again. That is inherently dangerous and annoying. 
- Fiddling with a screen instead of having buttons is distracting and not safe. Simple tasks like changing the air flow while driving is cumbersome because it's all through the touch screen. 
- Side mirrors are shit. The lip that faces you blocks some of the mirror no matter how I adjust my position and also in the rain it has issues. 
- The automatic windshield wipers are also shit. I'm not sure if they would even run during a hurricane. 
- The adaptive cruise control and lane assist in my Altima worked pretty much as well as it does in the Tesla and is a much cheaper car. 

Performance:

Pros:
- It's quiet. It's fast. It's a smooth ride. It handles great. It has a lot of modes you can change to your liking. The drivers seat is really comfortable. Instant torque is nice. 

Cons:
- Regenerative braking takes getting used to. If you get motion sick in cars, I'd imagine this will make it worse. 

Everything else:

PROS:
- Charging has been easier than expected. 
- Lots of space. 
- Center screen is great for navigation. 
- You feel like you are experiencing something new and cutting edge. 

CONS:
- The door handles are shit. They look cool. But it's hard to open the damn thing and sometimes it doesn't work. They are also hard to find in the dark. They can easily fix this by illuminating them like BMW does on the 4 series. And if they want to keep the aerodynamic design, the handle bar should pop out on its own when you approach the car to make them easier to use. 
- The app is shit and slow. I much rather have a key fob. It lags and takes a moment or two to connect to the car each time. A key fob is a lot better and faster for things like opening your trunk. Also the car auto locks when you walk away but if you are like me, you don't get the same peace of mind of mashing the lock button and knowing it worked. You're less in control. 
- Obviously I think the customer service sucks. 
- This may just be me but I have noticed pick up trucks driving aggressive near my car. I suspect that the pick up drivers are conservative folk and think of me in my Tesla as a liberal who opposes their views. 
- At every red light the cars next to me gun it as if to show me that their cars are fast, too. I used to get this a lot in the 4 series but in the Tesla it's all the time. Never happened in my Altima. 
- I knew going in that it wouldn't have Apple CarPlay, but I just rather have Apple CarPlay. Still, ""Hey Siri"" still works for making calls, sending texts and using Apple Music. But for navigating places I need to type it in each time which sucks and sometimes the car takes a minute or two to find the network for finding places. 
- The Tesla cult is annoying and I'm scared of being lumped with them. 

All in all the car is good. But it's not as great as the Tesla fanboys will have you believe. Driving it makes you feel like the early days of having an iPhone - it feels new, it's exciting and you can tell it's the future - but just like how the early iPhones didn't have simple features like copy and paste, this car also head scratchingly lacks a bunch of rudimentary features that should be a given in this price range. For a car that retails for over $50,000, a lot of times it feels like a car that really should be closer to $40,000, if not less.",I've been driving my Tesla for the past 3 weeks.

PUSH FOR MILITARY TO SAVE SUPPLY CHAIN

HAYDEN JOHNSON MATTHEW KILLORAN SAMANTHA SCOTT

AUSTRALIA‚ÄôS defence force should be mobilised to address the crippling worker shortages that are decimating food supplies under a plan put forward by a Queensland transport mogul.

Supermarket shelves have been stripped bare and there are concerns major disruption to national supply chains could extend to everyday items including pharmaceuticals over the next three weeks.

Followmont Transport chief executive Mark Tobin, who employs more than 1000 staff and is Queensland‚Äôs largest family-owned transport company, has about 400 workers across the eastern seaboard in isolation, infected with Covid-19 or on leave.

In the $250m company‚Äôs Brisbane head office about 150 of 380 staff are unable to work ‚Äì prompting three senior executives to start driving.

Mr Tobin said the lack of rapid antigen testing ‚Äúhas brought Queensland to a halt‚Äù and declared the worker shortage more serious than any disaster the state has faced.

‚ÄúWe go through all the cyclones and that but when you have a cyclone or a flood you‚Äôve still got people ‚Äì you‚Äôve got resources,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúMy frustration is there‚Äôs no direction from the government of what we‚Äôre going to do to overcome this ‚Äì this is going to go on for the next three weeks.‚Äù

Mr Tobin said the Commonwealth Government must consider mobilising the army to fill worker shortages and called for tax incentives to draw people into the industry over the long term. ‚ÄúWe just need to get bums on seats and I don‚Äôt know if the army is the answer but I‚Äôm in dire straits,‚Äù he said.

However, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the Defence Force was not a ‚Äúshadow workforce‚Äù that could be deployed to plug staff shortages across the country, even as he warned that any industry‚Äôs absenteeism could hit 10 per cent at any time during the peak.

It comes as national cabinet agreed to loosen close contact isolation rules for a range of industries, including health, emergency services, utilities, transport, freight, and resources.

While Queensland had already moved to do so on Sunday, there are now more nationally consistent guidelines which will simplify matters for transport and logistics companies operating across domestic borders.

It means close contacts of a positive case, defined as someone you live with or spend more than four hours with at their home, in those industries can get back to work if they are asymptomatic and return a negative rapid antigen test.

In Queensland, all close contacts still must get tested on day six and if they develop Covid symptoms.

Mr Morrison warned that modelling presented to national cabinet showed up to 10 per cent absenteeism from the workforce at any one time at Omicron‚Äôs peak, and that another five per cent would be added if schools did not open.

But he said Queensland, which is delaying the start of school by two weeks, made its decision based on the timing of the peak and the workforce issues would be mitigated as children of essential workers would be allowed to attend.

That is despite warning earlier in the week that Queensland delaying school by two weeks could push back the peak of the Omicron wave.

Mr Tobin said the supermarket stock shortages are just the beginning, with pharmaceuticals also at risk.

He said the ambiguity of isolation requirements, a lack of government direction and the likelihood of being infected with Covid meant workers were staying home ‚Äì forcing him to fly drivers from regional Queensland into Brisbane to backfill.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre nearly paying them danger money to work in Brisbane because they‚Äôre going to get it (Covid),‚Äù he said.

Energex spokesman Danny Donald said its companies, supplying electricity to more than 1.4 million domestic and business connections in South East Queensland, Energex and Ergon, have plans to ‚Äúmaintain Queensland‚Äôs reliable power supply.‚Äù

‚ÄúAt this time there are no operational or corporate impacts as a result of Covid and in fact our field crews have just worked to quickly restore supply to flooded communities in Wide Bay while adhering to Covid guidelines,‚Äù he said. Meanwhile, Urban Utilities water and sewerage services are ‚Äúcurrently unaffected‚Äù by Covid. A spokesman said crews were available ‚Äú24/7 to keep our networks operating across our service region‚Äù.

Cannon Hill-based meatworks Australian Country Choice has taken ‚Äúunprecedented safety measures‚Äù to maintain the supply of beef.

Chief executive Anthony Lee said AAC had introduced a range of new practices.

CLOSE CONTACT CHANGES

The industries getting relaxed close contact rules:

‚ñ† All transport, freight, logistics and service stations

‚ñ† Health, welfare, care and support (including production and provision of medical, pharmaceutical and health supplies)

‚ñ† Emergency services, safety, law enforcement, justice and correctional services

‚ñ† Energy, resources and water, and waste management

‚ñ† Food, beverage, and other critical goods (including farming, production, and provision but not including hospitality)

‚ñ† Education and childcare

‚ñ† Telecommunications, data, broadcasting and media What the eased rules are: For close contacts (household or household-like where you spend at least four hours with them): Remain quarantined, except to go to work if you are asymptomatic and test negative on a rapid antigen test. Return to quarantine if symptoms develop.

Queensland requires another test on day six.

Masks and additional PPE may be required. Monitor for symptoms until 14 days after exposure.",Time to Call in the Army - Courier Mail 14 Jan 2022,2.0,2.0
s8dwp7,"Y' all, some of the posts and comments on Alina are going too far. She's an asshole and needs to be called out in her problematic behavior and racism, however, She did not choose to be disabled and reading a lot of these comments on her in posts makes me feel ashamed for humanity. People are calling her a centaur, saying they threw up in their mouths, wanting to see her feet and claiming how grossed out they are and I quote, by her ""stumps."" I am so sorry to the disabled folks in this community who have had to read some of these things. Imagine already facing the world at such a disadvantage.

saxi4n,"Without the concept of a formal marriage contract, I can't see under any scenario where ""commitment"" by a man after sex would be expected for any time length.

Possible scenarios:

1. Both man and woman have sex but no discussion of commitment: Man surely doesn't need to offer female any commitment by default.
2. Both parties agree to sex but the female states she expects ""commitment"" which the male agrees to.   This can be an arrangement of sex for a few months, days or hours.   He can be ""committed"" for as long as he feels he wants and then end it.  How does one enforce commitment beyond any specified time?   He can change his mind at ANY time.

Keep in mind, women often have ""sex"" to secure commitment from men with far higher SMV then themselves and get ""pump and dumped"" in the process.  This is why women will always offer pre-marital sex to ""hook"" a male with higher SMV or they won't be able to get any interaction with the ""Chad"" tier male.

The ""price of admission"" for the AVERAGE woman with a ""Chad"" is to have sex without any formal commitment.  Without this, the AVERAGE woman would be forced to only marry their SMV peer male.

The guy in the couple had mentioned being ""a little bicurious"", the woman was one of those slightly odd straight women who have a real thing about gay sex. They suggested the idea one night when we'd all been drinking and I figured why not. I considered myself bi at the time so it wasn't that much of a leap. I'm not attracted to women on an emotional, romantic level but I'm not physically repulsed or something the way some gay guys seem to be.   
  
I thought it was pretty fun. I went down on her while her future husband fucked me from behind, other than that she mainly seemed more into watching. They wanted to do it again some time but it never ended up happening, kinda felt like once was enough anyway.

rxrsib,"Due to the overwhelming reaction to the news that Novak Djokovic has been denied entry to Australia to play in the opening Grand Slam event of the year, this thread is being created to serve as a placeholder to discuss anything related to it.

Any new discussion threads related to the topic, links to duplicated posts and content which isn't a significant news update to the story will be deleted. These can all go in the new thread here.

Please keep your comments civil, the subreddit rules are [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/tennis/about/rules/). If your comments break any of these rules they will be removed and may result in a ban. Repeated violations will result in a permanent ban. Please help the mod team by reporting any content you see and this will help us see things much faster. If you're interested in debating politics, there are other forums and subreddits for this which are more suitable. 

This story in isolation wouldn't usually warrant the creation of a megathread. However, the gravity of the worldwide reaction and flood of new users and content means, we need now consolidate this into a single place in order to retain focus on some of the actual tennis tournaments that are taking place this week including the ATP Cup, Adelaide International, Melbourne Summer Sets and Sydney Tennis Classic.

I have a boyfriend, and my best friend is now dating one of my roommates' girlfriends. It's a pretty weird relationship. I'm not a jealous person. I just don't like it.

There's other reasons, but I'll get to them.

Anyway, I've been having a hard time dealing with this. One of my roommates' girlfriends decided I was her new best friend. I told my best friend that I didn't want to be her friend anymore because it's only been a week and I don't know if there's any trust left. She said she was going to break up with her boyfriend and that she was going to be friends with me. I said it was OK if that happened.

sdxwzm,"**Please, do not tell me what to eat or how to exercise. I exercise every day, I do eat better than literally everyone I know, I had my thyroid checked.** My body just stores fat excessively whenever I am stressed.

Which is great, because I am stressed about my weight. During writing my thesis I gained yet again more than 20 pounds. I stopped scaling myself, as it just resulted in a breakdown every single morning. I do not fit in my old clothes, I have to order new ones online as stores do not have my size anymore. I need to go to the doctors, but I will not go because they will not even try to solve my problem, they will tell me to stop drinking sweet drinks or some other BS instead of helping me (Before you get triggered, last time I drank something that wasn't water or black coffee was three months ago. Before that probably early summer.).

I feel sorry for my BF to be seen in public with such a whale. I decline his invitations to have dinner dates, because I do not want to be seen eating in public.  I was never thin, so I am used to the constant discrimination and looks but this hit a new level. I haven't talked to most of my friends for about half a year because of this.

I did try to go to an obesitologist, I was told to ef off and try when there is no Covid anymore.  I am out of options and I see no solution available.

sg7jlq,"So many kids are physically and cognitively underdeveloped because we go hard on academics in Pre-K, Kindergarten and up, rather than focusing on what child development science says. Gross and fine motor skills DO affect language development! Here's a study. [https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.02670/full](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.02670/full)

Kids need a **minimum** of 1 hour per day of fine motor skills and 1 hour of gross motor skills.

We need to return to doing art projects where kids are cutting and gluing, handling materials like beads, tissue, glitter, etc. They should be cutting things in small pieces and carefully arranging and gluing them to paper. How many of us have met upper elementary and middle schoolers who have no idea how to use scissors?

We need kids playing board games, blocks, dress up etc learning about listening and cooperation skills and how to be a team player rather than close reading (text analysis) in third grade or five paragraph opinion essays. Where are the dioramas and models with modeling clay and a small written explanation? How about show and tell?

There should also be a minimum of 2 30 minute recesses daily even in the winter! Let the kids bundle up and GO OUTSIDE .They need to run around and play and they also need to touch dirt, leaves, snow etc! This is sensory development! When my class stays in the cafeteria and colors because it's 30 F they are like vegetables. When they play outside they are more alert. Of course , I put on Yoga and Go Noodle every day but there's nothing like being outside.

And by the way, none of these things are unrealistic. I had all of these as a public school student in the us in the late 90s and 00's. We just need to move away from the ""all kids and teachers are failing"" model and give kids WHAT THEY NEED. Activities that match their developmental level, that are fun, and educational.

&#x200B;

Edit: here's a list of toys/activities I recommend for kids 3+ that promote motor skills, problem solving, cooperation, and provide sensory stimulation:

Legos, kinetic sand, magnetic tiles, dolls, dress up, art supplies (paint, markers, crayons, coloring books, construction paper, glue, scissors), cars, jump ropes, balls of different sizes, weights, textures, chalk, crafts made with cotton balls, dried pasta, etc, board games of all kinds, cards, connect 4, jenga, blocks, twister, puzzles, word searches/ sodoku/crosswords... etc. Also I remember loving using a water balloons and a water gun (super soaker!) in the summer, used to battle it out with my siblings!",Kids are failing because their brains and bodies are UNDERDEVELOPED.,2.0,2.0

rvo82h,"Last year, I (23F) got my first ever pap smear and the results came out abnormal and I didn't know it was a big deal because my doctor didn't tell me about it nor was I even aware of HPV! I moved to the US and have access to public healthcare so I was lucky enough to get my pap smear for free. They also gave me the first shot of the HPV vaccine during my first pap smear, so I thought I was good and in the clear.

I grew up in a 3rd world country where healthcare isn't as accessible and the HPV vaccine is very costly. HPV awareness wasn't even a thing. The most rampant STD where I'm from (Philippines) is HIV and I got tested for it once a year since I became sexually active casually so HPV was never even on my mind.

This year, I got my second pap and they detected HPV in E6/E7 which means I have high risk HPV. I don't know the strain. I also have LSIL. So I think I'm going to go through some procedures if I'm not mistaken. I am overwhelmed by the amount of information that I have researched and I am spiraling. I never knew HPV was even a thing. I've been in several relationships and have engaged in casual sex and now I feel like this is the consequences to my actions. I feel like such a dirty whore.

My follow up is in two weeks and that's probably when I can actually talk to my doctor about it, but right now I am spiraling in HPV research hell. I've read mostly positive things about it and that it'll clear and that everyone practically has it, they just don't know the have it. So I'm in this limbo of worrying and just letting it run it's course.

What's bugging me the most is that I don't know how to tell my partner. He knows about my past partners and that I went through a phase so he's cool with it. But now I'm thinking, will he think I'm dirty now because I actually contracted something from my younger reckless days? 

We've been together for about a year now, is it safe to assume he has it already? Should we stop having sex till I get cleared or will it even matter? Will having HPV destroy my sex life? 

I've downloaded Tiktoks, bookmarked Reddit threads, CDC website, etc. Heck I even got the HPV joke Ali Wong had in one of her stand up shows to show him. 

I've read articles and threads about oral HPV and he literally gave me oral a week before I got my results. So will he contract oral HPV from giving me oral sex a weekend ago or is it an over time kind of thing? 

TL;DR: HPV+, researched so much my anxiety is gonna kill me first, don't know how to tell LTR bf. Send help.

Also if you don't have pics of your face or body on your profile, send them in chat...you can do that now!

I could get all the dick I wanted if I just did hookups. I am interested in more. I am looking for regular fwbs in the true sense. We text, hang out, road trip and fuck! Real friends with benefits. I am single, but non-monogamous and plan to stay that way. I am open to a non-monogamous relationship with the right person(s), but I'm not looking for it.

I am 43, live in SLC, near Capitol Hill. Looking for guys in SL area or Davis County. If you are in Davis you need to be able to host, or be willing to come to me in SLC. Looking for someone available regularly,  weekdays between 6-10 and weekends. I also like to plan my play dates out for the week, so you need to be willing to schedule things ahead of time and not flake.

I am attracted to slim/trim or dad bod guys (still trim, but may be a little soft in the middle)...usually younger, but if you're a silver fox with stamina, you'll do just fine. üòâ I like a dominant partner, but prefer a nurturing Daddy/babygirl dynamic over a traditional D/s dynamic. I am definitely into cuddling, I am a very touchy person and I will always be touching you.

I am multiorgasmic, a squirter and can go for hours. üòã I am rarely satisfied if its less than 90 minutes, an hour of PIV is like foreplay for me. üòè

Interested? Keep reading. You must: (these are all mandatory)

-have stamina and be able to last awhile and/or go multiple rounds 

-be single or ethically non-monogamous (and be willing to give proof)

-like cuddling & kissing (I promise I won't fall for you because we kiss!)

-enjoy foreplay (aka, worshiping my body! üòâ And letting me worship yours) 

-be dominant (in the bedroom), as I said I like a Daddy Dom

-be vocal and enjoy giving and receiving dirty talk

-be 420 friendly, I usually do an edible and/or smoke before sex (makes me cum faster and harder ü§™)

-be fully vaccinated against Covid

-have recent STI results or be willing to get tested

I love life, the mountains, good food and traveling! I am an introvert, pretty laid back and easy going. But I also like to spend time with my people, be silly and have fun!

If you are interested still and meet the qualifications, please message me a chat request and send body and face pics in chat! I'll send face pics if I respond. Thanks üíã",Read this before you message me!,2.0,2.0

Data from every other country shows a hugely lower incidence of hospitalisations and deaths with this variant regardless of previous infection rates or vaccination rates. This is despite there being more current infections around in most places than ever.

Hospitalisations and deaths have been higher in the US throughout the pandemic but the fact they remain so high with Omicron is inexplicable to me. This is not the case anywhere else.

ru59a8,"Depending on who you ask, we should cut our losses and get rid of one or both of our very expensive midfielders just 2 and a half years after signing them. Now, it's obvious they both have their issues. GLC is the new Lamela in terms of time spent injured if not necessarily skill, and Ndombele has had and continues to have issues with fitness of both mind and body. When they do play, Gio doesn't score enough and Tanguy doesn't *do* enough. Despite this, they both, at one point at least, have been considered two of our best players, with both having good spells under Jose Mourinho.

I had a look at their stats on transfermarkt.us to try and compare them using just their numbers. Here are the links to their respective pages: 

https://www.transfermarkt.us/tanguy-ndombele/leistungsdatenverein/spieler/450936

https://www.transfermarkt.us/giovani-lo-celso/leistungsdatenverein/spieler/348795

And here are the important numbers for both:

Ndombele: 89 appearances, 10 goals, 9 assists in all comps. 63 league appearances, 6 goals.

Lo Celso: 80 appearances, 8 goals, 5 assists in all comps. 54 league appearances, 1 goal.

Personally I always struggle to remember any noteworthy moments from Lo Celso, just because he's hardly provided any. Whereas Ndombele has scored 2 or 3 really special goals. As far as the numbers go however, they're actually fairly even. The big disparity is again Gio's lack of domestic output, with half of his goals coming in the Europa/Conference Leagues.

We all know about Lo Celso's performances for Argentina. He has 36 caps compared to Ndombele's 7 caps for France, with his most recent cap coming in March of last year. Mostly he doesn't make the squad at all.

Now I know stats aren't everything in football, especially for midfielders. Luka Modric and Mousa Dembele didn't score too often for us, yet they're most people's picks for our best midfielders of recent times. What the stats do show however is that both GLC and Ndombele have been underwhelming to say the least. 

They're both classy, skillful attacking midfielders that should have lit up the Premier League. Unfortunately the best you can say about the pair of them is that at least Ndombele has a highlight reel. Considering the money we spent on them, their measly G/A outputs and their unavailability at various times due to injuries and poor attitude I think it's time for them both to go. Ndombele ""is a midfielder"" and who knows if Gio will ever be fit enough to play consistently for us.

We have a certain someone, let's call him X, like that at my command that is one of the like, three people that are *universally disliked* by everyone in the command, because he treats everyone like dog shit and knows he can get away with things I'd probably be kicked out for if I even *thought* about doing.

One day a lower Enlisted came in, on his off time, to help out with an issue. When he was leaving, X decided to hold him back and yell at him FOR OVER AN HOUR, in front of anyone who happened to walk by, about being disrespectful to rank and being lazy. 

Because he didn't take out the trash on his way out.

The first time he fit left a bruise on me was when he was pinching my arm and shaking me kinda as a joke but I told him it hurt me and too stop. He didn‚Äôt stop and I ended up crying when I told him he left a bruise from that he said ‚Äúno duh, I was pinching your arm.‚Äù 

The most recent time was this past week, we were in bed and I had accidentally kneed him in the leg while trying to get comfortable. I quickly apologized but without hesitation he punched me in my leg and just said ‚Äúwhore‚Äù in an aggressive manner. This really caught me off guard and it did leave a bruise.

I‚Äôm not exactly sure who is wrong here. Probably both of us. One of the guys I have sex with pretty regularly came over a couple days ago.

I said something while we were on a little recovery break that implied he wasn‚Äôt the first guy I had sex with that day (which was true I had sex with a different guy earlier that day). 

I thought I was being sexy/naughty because he thinks it‚Äôs hott to call me dirty names and stuff in bed. Anyway, he was pretty upset. He said he could feel that I had been used early that day and I want as fresh as normal. He said some other hurtful stuff too.

I‚Äôm just wondering is it my responsibility to tell him this?

sbx8t2,"Whether it's due to looks, charisma, social status, charm, or any other factor, guys who are considered sexually attractive to women tend not to have a ""scarcity mentality"", wherein they feel an intense insecurity over whether any individual girl considers them attractive. This scarcity mentality seems to be the origin of 90% of the butthurt from guys on this subreddit.

It seems that the average guy here wants to be considered ""fuck on first sight"" material by women, and would accept a long term relationship ONLY under the condition the girl she's with never hooked up with other guys in the past. In his mind, the fact that she hooked up with some other guy but not with him indicates that she values him less and sees him as less attractive.

Now this may be true in some cases, but in the grand scheme of things, if you're not operating from an intense scarcity mentality, that shouldn't matter to you. If you're going on a date with a girl, you should be interested in her as a person, whether or not she wants to fuck right away or after some time getting to know you.

Let's say a guy has a date with a girl, and she makes some mention of him being perfect ""boyfriend material"".

Someone who knows how to talk to women, who understands when girls are flirting with him and doesn't put pussy on a pedestal will think:

>""Ah, so she cares for me and wants to go slow. That's fine with me and totally up to her. If I'd prefer a strictly sexual relationship, I'll tell her and break up, but if I like her I'll take it slow with her.""

While a guy with a naturally attention-starved scarcity mentality will think: 

>""Why does she not see me as hook-up material?? Am I not hot enough? Would she want to fuck me right away if I were hotter? Why don't I meet the standard that would make her want to fuck me right away? She must consider me a sexually worthless, exploitable beta male""

If your line of thought resembles the second one, you should be lucky she's even considering you worth eventually fucking at all. 

It's kind of like the maxim ""People will tell you if you're attractive, but if you're ugly you have to find out for yourself."" If you're someone for whom regular hookups are a natural option, being labeled ""boyfriend material"" by one woman doesn't matter, you understand women have different preferences at different points in their life. Even if she fucked other guys on the first date and wants to go slow with you, you know that you could get a hook-up somewhere else, so it doesn't bother you that this specific woman cares about you enough to want to take it slow.","If you're the kind of guy upset at a girl labeling you ""boyfriend material"", then you're probably not cut out to be ""hook-up material""",1.0,2.0

NOTE: if you don't want to read the entire thread, I felt like there were some really good suggestions down there. First, a 1000 lm flashlight with a strobe feature sounds like a great idea. Second POM OC spray got a lot of mentions. Third, I think the suggestion of a punch/push dagger is a great idea if one chooses to carry a knife - seems harder to mess up or lose in a fight/under stress. I also have to admit I was impressed with the hidden sword belt - didn't know such a thing existed. So thank you to everyone for chiming in.

Edit: for all the guys saying ""knife"" have you had any knife training or are you just hoping for the best? When I was a prosecutor the only two fatal stabbing cases I had were instances where the defendant had taken the knife away from the victim and killed them with their own knife. Since I have literally zero knife training I don't think that's a great idea, Even though it's the most obvious answer

Second edit: if you're going to answer ""carry anyway"" don't bother. First, a number of people of already beat you to it; second, I'm talking about places where even if you pull your gun and save a whole busload of nuns and children they will still prosecute you for carrying a concealed weapon

rzpm84,"My girlfriend and I have been together for almost 3 years, and some times thing have been tough, and sometimes I said some things that I regretted, but I've always tried my best for her. She went back home from college before I did as we went to different colleges, and she started hanging out with my friend group.

 One of the people she hung out with, outside of my friend group was someone who had begged her to take his virginity while he was drunk, to be anonymous I'll call him Chase. I told her I didn't want to tell her who to hang out with because it wasn't my place, but I wasn't super comfortable with it. She told me I was being controlling and overbearing, and I told her this a few times but her responses were the same.

 Eventually she went to drink at a pool hall with a group of my friends, and when they got back, she hooked up with one of my best friends, got caught, and everyone there tried to hide it from me. We ended up breaking up because I felt like she didn't make time for me anymore, and prioritized everyone else over me. 

She kept telling me how I was paranoid about her hanging out with those guys and how I was taking trying to take her away from her friends. I felt bad, so I called Chase and apologized, I buried the hatched with him because if that was what i was doing I didn't meant to. Chase told me what happened, and my ex called me ""a manipulative bastard who deserves to rot in hell"".

 It just feels like all my friends are against me and I was just trying to do what was right. She still wants to stay friends, and I told her I was willing to, and I was willing to still try for her in a relationship but she couldn't be friends with the person she had sexual relations with.

 Maybe that's a harsh thing of me to ask, everyone seems to think so. And I asked my friend the same thing. I just feels that no one had any respect for me, and everyone is telling me I'm a terrible person and I can't take it anymore and I don't know where to turn.

 My girlfriend of 3 years just told me a friendship with a guy who's moving 6 hours away after she had sexual relations with him was more important than me. Am I wrong to feel the way I do? Am I in the wrong?

I am so thankful to each and everyone of you who's responded. It's the first time in so long I feel like I can talk to someone about my situation without being ridiculed or made to feel like nothing. It's brought me on the verge of tears and I am just so glad there are people in the world like you

s0ariv,"fuck bald cont

not a single thing in this meaningless universe can describe how much hatred I have for this pitiful excuse of a human being. the pure evil within this bald fucking gay cunt is unparalleled. this bald bussy licking spaznoid makes fucking Adolf hitler look like a normal fucking political leader. I would rather sell my soul to the devil himself than take a glimpse at that shockingly bald fucking face ever again in my entire life. ok so about bald cunt, 1. he is fucking bald and has an ugly fat face and a malnourished fucking body he deserves to die of dehydration in a fucking desert and get picked apart and eaten by vultures. 2. he got cucked by a black bald cunt. 3. he is immortal, this guy has pulled a William Afton on us countless times as seen in his shitty adverts, where he gets submerged in lava and suffers an excruciating fate, then returns not minutes later in another fucking advert. WHEN WILL THIS BALD FUCKING CRACKHEAD BASTARD DIE??? 4. his toilet doesn't work lol. the only glimpse of happiness I get in my depressing life having to witness bald cunt every day is seeing the picture of his broken toilet, lmaoooo imagine not being able to take a piss or a shit I love the way bald cunts eyes water in desperation because he can't go piss in his broken ass toilet. 5. HES BALD LMAOOOO LOOLLLLLL XDDDFF IMAGINE NOT HAVING HAIR LOL I HAVE BEAUTIFUL HAIR WHICH IM GROWING OUT BUT THIS MOTHEFFUCKER CUNT BALD BITCH HAS NONE EXCEPT THE GAY ASS SIDEBURNS HE HAS ON HIS DEMONIC FUCKING HEAD LOLLLLLLLLLLL. 6. bald cunt is infertile and cannot produce sperm. also bald cunt has no penis or scrotum just a little nub where his todger is supposed to be. 7. BALD CUNT IS OLD LOL HES LIKE 70 I THINK AND HE HASNT GOT MUCH TIME LEFT, EVEN THOUGH HES IMMORTAL FOR NOW, THE DEVIL WILL SOON TAKE HIS EMPTY, SHALLOW SOUL TO THE DARKEST ABYSS OF HELL FOR ALL ETERNITY. MEANWHILE IM ONLY 13 I STILL HAVE MANY YEARS BEFORE I GET IN MY FOREVER BOX, AND AT THE MOMENT MY LIFE IS GREAT IVE REALLY BEEN WORKING ON MYSELF I STARTED NOFAP A WHILE BACK AND IM STILL GOING STRONG.
MY ONE TIP FOR LIFE IS TO SLAG OFF EVERYONE THAT ISNT NICE TO YOU AND ALWAYS BE NICE TO THOSE WHO ARE NICE TO YOU.TREAT PEOPLE THE WAY YOU WANT TO BE TREATED GUYS. ALSO START WORKING OUT IF YOU DONT ALREADY BC THAT SHIT MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE YOU JUST WATCHED BALD CUNT DIE A MILLION TIMES. anyways. I'm gonna discuss how we can punish bald man for his sins. now like I said his soul deserves to be banished to the darkest layer of hell but he's immortal and can still feel pain just like any other human being so here's some ideas.
1. the purple bald cunt punishment.
basically what happened to purple man from fnaf but it happens to bald cunt.
2. permanently forced to watch playrix ads, no skipping, no breaks. this will be satisfying.
3. sent to purgatory to be taunted forever by people with hair. Imagine being bald cunt lol.
4.banish bald cunt to the deepest, darkest, most claustrophobic cave ever to be imagined. no food no water minimal space. rats live in the cave too and eat  
humans. and if you think the sweet release of death can save him now. you are very much wrong. not that his soul would to go to a good resting place anyways. if bald cunt ever dies in there he will come back perfectly fine, only to relive the same horrors again, and again, and again. for all eternity lol. the only thing that varies is how he dies, broken bones, bleeding out, eaten by rats, dehydration, who knows! that's the fun part.
now conclusion is there are many more things to say about bald big nose bastard bitch but I have better things to do than write about my passion for hating bald cunt",Found on r/FuckHomescapes,0.0,2.0

The developer needs to find solution to this problem and get some kind of sound expert. Reduce the loudness of noise or change frequency so it doest effect players in negative way.

sd6cab,"Last week my wife surprised me after coming home pretty drunk after a night out with her friend. While cuddling in bed she says ""I want you to hurt me."" 

She's never delved into this before, except ever so slightly. I've slightly choked her before here or there in the past a few times, but not enough to prevent her from breathing, more like a firm grip. So, from that prompt, I asked her to tell me what she means exactly. This is the conversation that happened.

Her - ""I want you to be rough with me. Control me.""

Me  - ""Spanking?""

Her - ""Yes""

Me  - ""Biting?""

Her - ""Yes""

Me  - ""Slapping?""

Her - ""Not too hard, but yes""

Me  - ""Choking?""

Her - ""I trust you.""

I was sort of in shock that she expressed these desires, since nearly the entire time we've been together (over 10 years) she's been a VERY vanilla person in bed. Only the last couple of years has she been open to new things.

So, now I'm just curious about this kink and sure I can watch videos, but I feel that unless I get lucky and watch the right ones, I'll have a distorted view in my head. I don't want to do something that's too much for her and then she no longer wants to do this.

As for me, the controlling part is what gets my motor going, not so much the physical *abuse* part. I'm mostly neutral to the slapping and choking, but the picking her up and putting her where I want her. The holding her down and making her do what I want. Those are the parts of this that I enjoy.

**UPDATE:**

Thank you for all the wonderful feedback. It has been 99% positive *((you know who you are 1%)*

I would like to add that we have a very strong relationship, and we talk a lot about things of this nature. So, even though I went along with this knowing she was under the influence, I also knew that she was not completely drunk. We also have talked about this twice since it occurred, and I wanted more clarification of what she wanted, as well as how long she has thought about these things, and to go over the things we (more specifically *I*) that she liked, or didn't like. Things I should do more of, or less of, or additional things she may want me to do.

I have also brought up a few of your suggestions to her via text (she's working atm) and she seemed to be very enthusiastic about each of them.

The other day my friend comes over and pulls out his cock and I started sucking almost without thinking. It‚Äôs just a reaction now.
So some time into it he grabs my head and drags me backwards to a wall so the back of my head is against it and I have no escape (this is important for what he does next‚Ä¶) and immediately begins skull fucking me!!!

I couldn‚Äôt stop.. I didn‚Äôt want to stop him!! I could feel every part of me start to tingle, and my pussy immediately got wet. He and that meat own me and it isn‚Äôt fair.
After what was probably half an hour he stopped, drool running down my chin.. he grabbed the drool and shoved it all over my face.
It was at that point I realized I was in trouble. It wasn‚Äôt that I liked it or hated it, it was the fact that I didn‚Äôt have a choice that I enjoyed.

He stood me up by the hair, turned me around, and began ramming his cock in my pussy, hard.
I mean the kind of fucking that you might call ‚Äúhate fucking‚Äù, so hard I felt like my hips might break.
He went on for I don‚Äôt know how long, but until I was raw.
He finally shoved his cock in my ass so hard I almost screamed except for his whispering ‚ÄúStay quiet or I‚Äôm going to make you earn that scream.‚Äù

He must have cum because his cock got soft in my ass, he left it there while he groped my chest and left hickeys all up and down my neck.

When he pulled out, he turned me around, grabbed me by the chin and made me look into his eyes as he said ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre mine. No matter how much of a little free use toy you are, you‚Äôll always be mine.‚Äù

s80qj2,"I think I have seen a recurring pattern in ppd where people are discussing an issue like cheating, single moms, n count but it eventually devolves into people making it personal.

If a person makes a point about men or women on average, a reply would ask him if he personally would date single moms. If he personally cares about n count. If he is an incel or a virgin.

I wonder if this adds any value to the debate? Some ideas I have for why it happens is,

&#x200B;

1) People are not really debating to understand the topic, the consequences or change their mind. They **like to troll**, flame and have fun making it personal.

2) People think that the answer matters because it shows **a conflict of interest** or hypocrisy. For example if a single mom is saying single dads are not worth dating in one comment, then if they argue single moms should not be disadvantaged elsewhere the person is trying to bring to everyone's attention that this person is not self consistent in their views.

3) As Aristotle famously said there are 3 modes of persuasion. Since most people in ppd have already made up their mind what the answer is, it is a matter of winning the argument and persuading others who are listening. Instead of only relying on logos, people are **using ethos** to destroy the credibility of the speaker. If the person once mentioned something politically incorrect that reflects badly on his character or by bringing attention to his occupation, educational qualifications, you can try to avoid having to address the point the person raised. This is also a **form of pathos** where you are trying to win over the audience's emotions. 

4) It helps to put a face or human behind the reddit handle. By making it personal, you get an idea of **the context** behind the person's comment. It helps to undersand the culture he is from, if they are worth engaging with or is an obvious troll.

5) Most people find it hard to keep the discussion at an abstract level - it feels disconnected from their life to discuss n count in general, or dating single moms in general, when there is just so much diversity. Like people say, what constitutes an increment to an n count? people have different definitions, so it becomes hard to have a discussion on that level where these words don't have a clear meaning. Most people can't abstract out a number intuitively given many people and details of their sexual past. So to make the discussion meaningful they dig deeper into the concrete and talk about actual people and thier sexual history and the n count you might assign and how you would judge that single individual. By relying ancedotal evidence, personal stories and concrete cases they hope to get a better idea of the words so that they can later generalize?

I am wondering if you all also noticed this pattern? if there are any additional points I might have missed that explains why people do this? overall do you think it contributes positively to debate and discussion? 

Finally do women do it more than men?

sa9c1s,"Today I felt really understimulated, bored, depressed etc, I really didn't feel like doing anything. And on days like these it can often happen that I masturbate a LOT or for long periods of time.

I know it is because we're subconciously trying to reach the stimulation we need, and I know that ways to cope with that would be to look for a hobby that you really enjoy, something that stimulates you in a different way.

But even though I know all that, I wasn't strong enough. And I took the easy way and masturbated, instead of doing sport or trying to meet up with friends. And I looked at porn and other pornographic material until it was enough after a couple hours.

I just want to say that even if you know the solution to your struggles, you may not be able to execute them. Sometimes it is like that. Today made me accept that a bit more about myself, but I still don't like it.

rtc751,"So I started a new job at a certain supermarket in November. The job was NOT the description that I was sold or given, even remotely.. I had no training or anything and I was supposed to be a team leader and ended up stacking shelves for my entire 9/10 hour shift every day.. which would be okay if that‚Äôs what I signed up for but I didn‚Äôt, so fuck that! Then My life took a turn and my mental health went to shit, or more shitter than it was already. My relationship was extremely strained, I had family issues back home in my home country, and now my new job was absolutely shite and I was dreading going to work and hating every minute of it. So I got signed off for 2 weeks and then for a month with mental health issues/stress. I spoke to my work and asked them to reduce my hours/adjust my shifts to help me out and I gave them fair warning and explanation for my issues. Anyway.. fast forward to the day I‚Äôm supposed to get paid a month worth of sick pay, which I REALLY need, to live on.. and there‚Äôs lots of back & forth and it seems that what‚Äôs happened it that my manager was either a dick or didn‚Äôt know, and my sick lines weren‚Äôt submitted so I got paid ¬£70 for the entire month.. and now they‚Äôre ignoring my communications about it..

This lady's son was in the car sobbing because he had witnessed his beloved dog murder his two cats, but this nutter chose to keep the dog in the end! Our vet offered to put the dog down, saying once its attacked and killed, its unlikely to stop and might escalate to humans. But nope, she said the dog is still family.

sdt17m,"Hi all, a bit of self promotion here. I'm the author of NWB/NIT and I have a new addon with a bunch of raid helpers and logging features for TBC raids you may find useful. Most of what this addon does is basically just things I wanted for myself while raiding and you can get it here [https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/nova-raid-companion](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/nova-raid-companion) the first release has been up for a couple days.

**Some of the features:**

Quick and easy viewing of the entire raid's buffs/consumes/durability (left click minimap button to open this). All this data can be seen for every member in the raid even if they don't have this addon installed. Buffs/consumes that aren't max rank are shown in red. You can hide any of the columns in config. The buff columns are also clickable to target that player.

&#x200B;

Click the ""More"" button top right and it will expand to show some extra things like resistances/weapon oils/spec and talents, these extra columns work for players that have the addon installed or if your raiders don't use the addon you can just share the NRC helper weakaura and then you will see their data ([https://wago.io/sof4ehBA6](https://wago.io/sof4ehBA6)).

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/njkg5hjdn6e81.png?width=929&format=png&auto=webp&s=c2378a913c0a1c75cdb22752285f68313fa5ddb3

Clicking on a players spec icon in the the last column (Talents) will open a talents frame so you can see which talents they have trained, hover over talents for description just like the blizzard talent frame.

Detailed logging window for each raid and boss you kill/wipe on (right click minimap button to open this log). Snapshots of the raids buffs/consumes window above for every boss so you can see what buffs/consumes etc were up at time of pull. It also shows loot, deaths, talents, boss models with health and race etc. With plans for more logging features as I get time.

Raidwide cooldown tracking that can even track your party neck buff cooldowns, also displays a timer bar with who currently has a soulstone buff on them. It has 2 display modes, ""merged"" is smaller and shows the buff name and has mouseover tooltips to show which players have how long on cooldown, or an ""unmerged"" option to show a longer list displaying player names always. Active soulstone buffs are shown below each type.

It also has a bunch of other small features that will be expanded on like viewing all your alts raid lockouts (hold shift while hovering minimap button or click ""Rad Lockouts"" button in the raid log). A durability warning if you enter a raid with less than 50% armor. A warning if you start combat with no weapons after a KT kill or if you wiped it will warn you of missing weapons when the RP starts for next try. Summoning stone group chat msg so you can coordinate who you're summoning. There's plans to add class specific helpers but for now it just has some warlock stuff. And lastly a mostly useless but kinda fun feature you can turn on is a little frame that shows how long any NPC in the game has been spawned for, this can tell you how long a layer has been up or how long a raid ID has been open.

When you first install the addon just hold shift to drag where you want the cooldowns frame and it will disappear until you join a raid, you may also want to open config options by shift + right clicking the minimap button or typing /nrc config to choose extra raid cooldowns to display (it shows battle resses by default but you can add necks and extra cooldowns for each class like inervate/hero etc). Please let me know of any issues or feature requests, thanks!  -Novaspark-Arugal","Nova Raid Companion, a new addon to view your entire raids buffs/consumes/oils/durability/resistances/talents with 1 click, raid wide cooldown tracking, raid data logs for viewing, and much more.",2.0,2.0

s41kcq,"I‚Äôm leaving my second job after a year of draining work with a controlling boss who doesn‚Äôt actually understand anything administrative. It‚Äôs a small private mental health practice and I was the only one in the office from March to September. I‚Äôm burnt out. 

I taught myself 95% of that job and put so many systems in place that I created, which they desperately needed in case of an audit. When we hired a new person in September, my boss told me we were going to be paid the same and freaked out at me for any time we both spent on the clock as I trained her. Pretty soon, I was answering a million questions off the clock. 

Last week, I told her I plan to leave but didn‚Äôt give a specific time frame as she is a genuinely good therapist and I didn‚Äôt want to leave the practice in a lurch by being abrupt. She texted me on Saturday and told me I was training my replacement on Wednesday. 

Two minutes before the replacement got there, she informed me she was giving a raise to the other girl and starting the new girl at a few dollars an hour more than I make ($16). When the girl got there, my boss told her that I‚Äôm too anxious for the job and implied I‚Äôm not capable of being a therapist (my goal - I start grad school this year).

I told my boss I‚Äôd be available for three weeks from my last day to answer questions by text as I‚Äôm still the only one who knows a lot of things, but that I‚Äôd no longer be available after that. She just looks me in the eye and shrugged and says ‚ÄúI mean I‚Äôll always be able to ask you.‚Äù And I just froze. 

I‚Äôm so angry and hurt. I feel that I‚Äôve been taken advantage of for the last year and that she‚Äôs still trying to.

Edit: I know I‚Äôve messed up in trying to keep the relationship and what I‚Äôve let her get away with. Hopefully I can be strong and firm as I leave and chalk this up to a learning experience.

Edit 2: Wow the response has been huge. You guys definitely woke me up. I just sent out a practice wide email, letting everyone know my last day is Wednesday and they need to ask me any questions they have before then. I laid out some expectations, not quite as firm as some of you suggested but it‚Äôs a huge step in advocating for myself which I‚Äôve always struggled with. Thanks for the feedback!

Edit 3: I just posted this in a comment but for those asking why I think she‚Äôs a good therapist I said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying to read through the 2k+ comments now and I‚Äôll address that! I base it on two things: the way her clients talk about her and the way she acts/talks in what we call staffing sessions, which is basically where the therapists put their head together when they get stuck with a client. It‚Äôs literally like she becomes a different person with all this patience, knowledge, and insight. I‚Äôve described her snapping into therapist mode to a lot of people over the last year. ‚Äú I think people sometimes choose what parts of you they show you. I bet a lot of her clients wouldn‚Äôt want to see her if they saw how she is to me, but they don‚Äôt.",My boss told me she was paying my replacement more and she expects to be able ask me questions indefinitely after I leave.,2.0,2.0

sc589z,"When I went through puberty, I began to look very different and I started to hear more comments about how ‚Äúugly‚Äù I was. I became very shy from the fact that people viewed me this way and I started to become very quiet. 

Usually whenever I meet someone, they assume that I‚Äôm angry or going to kill someone. I‚Äôve been told that I look like a school shooter, a pedophile, and all sorts of bad things throughout my teens that have affected me. 

Heading into college, I started to groom myself much more. I learned how to cut my hair, started working out, tried going for a more outgoing personality and tried to smile more‚Ä¶ but people still kind of get the same impression of me. 

I was looking out the window a few nights ago while I was with a group of friends and one of them joked ‚Äúwho are you planning to murder tonight.‚Äù That same night he was talking to his friends about how a girl he knew was so desperate to get with anyone that even ‚Äúsomeone like me‚Äù has a chance.

I can‚Äôt stand that I‚Äôm stuck with this face. Every time I‚Äôm not smiling and resting my face, someone asks me if I‚Äôm okay or comments how unsettling I look. 

I get that it‚Äôs a defense mechanism to stay away from me or funny to joke about how I look like a serial killer but people don‚Äôt realize that I‚Äôm a human being with feelings. 

I tried making up for the way I look by trying to be be kind and putting time aside to help out friends with favors, but most of the time they ignore my existence unless they want something from me. My neighbor knocked on my door at 3 AM while I was sleeping so he and his friends could borrow my Nintendo Switch. All of my roommates borrow all my stuff so much to the point where they stopped thanking me. I just learned that they have a group chat that I‚Äôm excluded from. 

I‚Äôm tired of being avoided for being ugly and socially awkward, with those same people only acting like a friend unless they need something or want a punching bag in their group to laugh at. 

I know that I should take control of my life and cut these people out, but it‚Äôs not very fun being alone and knowing that the majority of people I come across will continue to see me as a threat/predator and avoid me.",I hate being scary-looking to others,2.0,2.0

[So good](https://www.afr.com/chanticleer/bunnings-puts-the-sizzle-in-community-engagement-20190111-h19yqw) according to the Fin Review. No doubt, Bunnings have absolutely nailed the community engagement model.

Something else they nail everyday is LOW PRICES. Bargains abound.

Bunnings not only dictates the products required, also the price. Unchanged since 1996 from what I can find online. Please correct me if I'm wrong.

This post is based purely on my own experience as a volunteer for my local charities for as long as I recall - $2.50 for a sausage & $1.50 for a can of fizz. This was tidy in 1996. It's 2022.

Inflation is a thing. Pretty sure the Bunnings big heads get it. Why can't they pass this on to the most most needy in their communities? Or is a $4 sausage & drink offering more important to the brand than the amount provided the local charitites they apparently support? Kick it an additional 50c AT LEAST for each snag & can, that would be huge for your local charity group of volunteers.

People have lost jobs, family, homes, businesses. 

Cost of living is rising. Taxes are increasing. Utilities are going up. Food and petrol is going up. The list goes on.

The government has become corrupt and allegedly colluding with the police (no evidence yet however). It is an embarrassment globally. 

Yet everyone remains quiet and at home. No one says a peep. They keep their stiff upper lip. 

In India, they protest about everything. The farmers there recently protested for over a year and took over the streets, and overturned government policy. The French are notorious protestors. The US came out of their homes in droves for anti racism. The list goes on.

So why are we like this? So impotent, meek, docile and passive. 

Time for some serious reflection

Edit: thank you everyone for your insightful comments. I am trying my level best to read through each of them to get to the crux of the issue.

I note that many have suggested that we have no need to protest as we are privileged and unlike many countries around the world. This is almost like colonial/empire fantasising but could be deemed a reasonable point by some. However, see the latest news this morning from Canada, a country much like ours-

Justin Trudeau had to run away and hide today becase a truckers protest came to Ottowa. https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/trucker-convoy-canada-freedom-ottowa-b2002815.html

rux6y3,"I'm blown away by how bad the Menulog service is. They're spending all of this money on advertisements with **Snoop dog** and **Kim Kardashian** etc on tv and youtube, but their service doesn't even work. They need to actually fix their service and their app first! They can't handle the demand as it is.

On top of that, it seems as though they're playing a KPI's game with delivery status and delivery time numbers.... probably for someones bonus i.e. marking order status incorrectly consistently to make their numbers appear more positive.

* They frequently mark orders as delivered a long time before they're actually delivered
* Consistently arrives an hour or more later than estimated
* The ETA time doesn't update on the app. It consistently says it's going to arrive at a time that's in the past...
* When you call them, they actually give you a realistic ETA estimate. But that's not what the app says. Why doesn't the app say the correct ETA? Unless they're intentionally rigging the stats?
* Everytime you contact them they say they're ""experiencing high demand today"". But that's literally everyday! They need to fix the service to not accept some orders if that's the case.
* I end up just getting a refund and giving up on the order more than 50% the time lately. It's no longer worth even trying in my area.
* When your order is marked delivered but isn't here, the phone-line doesn't work because too many people are complaining. Then you join the chat queue which is over 50 people complaining till it's your turn!
* The poor drivers have to cop the pressure that this system puts on them by menulogs disorganisation

On the other hand, **Uber eats** just removes options that it can't deliver in time and doesn't let you order if they're too busy. Which is a much better experience.I know Uber eats has a bad social reputation. But at least the service is good and predictable.

It seems like Menulog is just waiting to crumble as a company if they don't fix this. It can't maintain this. If I could short the company I would.

sd22d4,"Something to cheer up (many seen it already but still) in the time where we have a little slip and currently performance and result wise in a tough period. Also transfer wise, it's been really quite till now. I just saw the Wrighty's video of him meeting his first teacher after so long who took him under his wing.
The whole video clip is a pure bliss. The expression of surprise, the shock he was in to see him, the hat coming out as if he's a school boy again, those dialogues of you're alive but someone said you dead, the hugs the talks. It's just all so surreal and explains why arsenal has loved him through and through because this very man reflects Arsenal values at its core. He's so humble, respectful, always a joyful character, never speaking ill off your cub but surely criticizing them in a professional manner is all what makes Ian a man of the highest level. 

Watching that video brought tears to my eyes and i just can't stop thinking about it.

[r/antiwork has reopened with a statement posted here](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/sdwd28/statement_rantiwork/) addressing the fox interview, future interviews, and sexual assault allegations against their (now former) top mod. [Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20220127134809/https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/sdwd28/statement_rantiwork/)

[The source of the accusations against the former top mod.](https://imgur.com/a/zWwJEoF)

The top mod (abolishwork) has either stepped down or been removed by the admins. Unsure which yet.

[A newly created mod account was added. Coincidence?](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/se4dhe/a_16_hour_account_has_been_made_a_mod_here/) And the account is now deleted.

~~Kimezukae is no longer a mod of r/antiwork.~~ Nevermind, they're still on the list and doing an impromptu AMA [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/sd9ohb/whats_going_on_with_rantiwork_and_the_fox_news/hueuhww/).

Kimezukae, the 21 year old anarchist mod, [has announced their resignation](https://www.reddit.com/user/Kimezukae/comments/se8nkj/stepping_down_as_an_rantiwork_mod/) and is no longer on the modlist for AntiWork. And deleted. [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/NrN9llL.png).



Meanwhile on /r/antiwork, users are also suspicious [of the new mod's true identity](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/se4jpt/congratulations_to_our_newest_moderator_who_made/), and some users also complain about a self appointed spokesperson being a [21 year old ""long term unemployed"" anarchist](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/se4je8/transparency_is_key/), who [keeps removing posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/se4220/posts_about_the_21_yr_old_anarchist_keep_getting/).

r/antiwork/new is a shit show. Mods gave up holding back the flood?

[Possible relationship between the former top mod and the deleted 21 yo anarchist](https://i.redd.it/ulk2np450ce81.jpg).



New mods have been added to r/antiwork, looks like they're recruiting from known reddit mod pools. [This was posted and almost immediately removed by one of them.

s3ywwm,".....I use lube.  I'm dead serious.  Using lube makes you a slut according to this 30 year old guy. He said he didn't need lube because he's not dried up or something.  Implying he got that good bussy. That no lube needed go to pound town bussy. 


Now I'm not one to judge others.  You do you.  However, I will not be criticized for using lube by a bottom who doesn't douche.


I don't care if you douche or don't.  My last exclusive partner literally said "" I want to have more spontaneous sex so we will lay a towel down incase of an accident."" He also told me about how he accidentally shitted everywhere one of the three times he bottomed to ensure me he totally understands if it happens.  


So I don't judge...I prefer to douche but I'mma tell ya right now....Mr ""no lube needed"" is going to have your dick looking like the arm of Dr Sadler digging through that Dino poop in Jurassic park. I hope you wash your hands before you eat anything.


Yeah you might not need lube but my hookups don't have to wear a nose plug when hitting it from the back.  Also funny that I'm a slut when you're the one who's last 3 hookups were all guys cheating on their partners by hooking up and breeding you.... But that's none of my business. 


 Also I'm a slut but you got that the no lube needing hole? The only other bottoms I knew who didn't need lube were getting dicked down regularly... Like they had mad hole control and lots of practice.  Soo curious that you aren't a slut but have the ability to receive dick so easily without lube.....I just don't know guys.  I almost feel like the less lube you need the bigger the slut?  *I'm joking and being a bitch. Don't mean to slut shame and please don't take offense.*


*I don't mean to offend any of the no douche bottoms out there.  I'm irritated with this particular guy for thinking he's better because of it.  You should do what's best for you and your body.  I think the community has enough stigma to deal with without stigmatizating lube usage or douching.


Also slut shaming is so lame.  If you want monogamy go for it.  If you enjoy hookups then do it.  Everyone get your sti testing done and practice appropriate harm reduction.    Literally stigmatizing the choices of others is so immature..... Unless that choice harms other people like not letting your partners know if you tested positive for Chlamydia.",I got called a slut by another bottom because....,2.0,2.0

sg8muj,"I've recently had my utility room redecorated, involving a re-paint and some tiling being done.

&#x200B;

I hired a local professional painter and decorator to do this work for me, and it's taken him a couple of weeks to finish the job. He's coming back tomorrow morning to put some finishing touches in, and collect payment.

&#x200B;

The price quoted was ¬£550 for all of the above.

&#x200B;

The painting is complete, and although it's not spectacular, it's 'acceptable', but the tiling on the other hand is really bugging me, as you can see from the photographs - chipped tiles, uneven grouting, not lined up properly etc.

&#x200B;

I'm so disappointed in the tiling that I've been round to ask a local neighbour if they can rectify it, and they've agreed to come and sort it out tomorrow night (obviously they will charge me for putting the work right).

&#x200B;

Do you think I would be within my rights to subtract the amount my neighbour charges me from the painter and decorator's fee, to get this rectified?

&#x200B;

I know that if I don't get it put right, every time I go into the utility room, I'm going to get more and more annoyed with the shoddy workmanship.

Last month I had a experience with this guy who has been being my sub for the past few months. I am a 29 year old BBW(315 lb). He is 20, 5'5"", 120. I had been having him over once a week and doing face sitting/smothering with him. He has been letting me tie him down to this bench I have and putting a ball gag in his mouth. Through practice we came to realize he could withstand me sitting on his face for about 2 minutes before needing to regain his breath. Our session last between 30 to 60 minutes. Things had been going fine with this until last week when we let another woman join us. I was sitting on his face like I normally do while she was sitting on his chest/mid section. She is about 20 lbs heavier than I am. I feel its my fault for not considering the complications of this woman sitting on him would cause as far as him being able to fully get his breaths back during the points I let up on him. After a little more than a half hour of doing this the guy ended up on the verge of passing out. Thankfully he came back out of it quickly.

s57gdh,"Around Christmas-time during my last year of college, I ended up having my entire apartment to myself and decided to take advantage of the situation. Feeling super frisky my first night alone, I sat back in my briefs with nothing else on and started chatting up guys online (as usual!). 

I always had a lot of luck around any holidays since it seems like there was an influx of guys with more free time to get something going and this time was no exception. Immediately, i had several older guys hitting me up right after posting and got lost in the conversations. It was maybe around 9pm when I got started so I knew I had a long night ahead of me. 

After some sexting and exchanging pics, next thing I knew I was already getting to the point of setting up with 5 or so different guys, 2 of them former connects and 3 of them strangers. I'll spare you the details of coordinating this all and skip ahead to let you know that 2 of them went out of touch at one point or another. The earliest guy that could drop by was C (33m). 

C was a larger guy about my height with an average but great looking cock. This would be my first time with him. He seemed friendly and handsome enough and gave me enough indication that it would be a fun and safe time. I gave him directions to my place and let him know to text once he got there. I put on some clothes to greet him (gray sweatshirt and some black sweats) and found him at my door about a half hour later. 

I led him up to my room and sat him on the edge of my bed and immediately started pulling his pants down. He took his time caressing behind my head and around my shoulders ready for me to start with him. I didn't make him wait too long as I started kissing his cock up and down and slowly worked my way down licking around his balls. He leaned back while I took him in deeper and sped up slowly bobbing my head back and forth passionately. 

After a few minutes he asked me up onto the bed and took all my clothes off before proceeding. He had me on all fours as he spit on his cock and started rubbing it against my asshole. I moaned as I felt him press against me slowly working his way in while he grabbed and caressed my balls and squeezed my ass with his other hand. After grabbing some lube and a condom from my nightstand I took him all the way in. 

He pounded me hard for a few minutes slowly at first and then speeding up once I could take it. I clenched onto the sheets feeling him get as far as he could into me and hearing him grunt with each stroke. My face was hot and flushed at this point from the feeling as he turned me around and started to jerk himself off into my chest while removing the condom and worked his way up to my face. 

I took it all from him happily as he left his massive load all over me. He caressed me for a few minutes and asked if I wanted to get taken care of though I had other plans and let him know that I was okay. Once C cleaned himself up, said goodbye, and headed out, I continued chatting with my next guest, N (28m). 

I had played with N about 2 times previously when he had picked me up in his car and we had sucked eachother off (in what was another great story!). I was still covered in C's cum when I started chatting him up again letting him know I was free whenever he could stop by while sending him some pics. He lived local and wasn't too far away so he was around within 20 minutes. I greeted him at the door only having covered myself with a small towel. 

He smiled when he saw me and asked about the previous encounter as I described it to him. He definitely seemed turned on about it as he got to my bed and asked me to demonstrate. I smiled and sat him down where I sat C and started sucking his cock too. N was a few inches taller than me and a lot bigger overall and had a lot of strength that i could feel whenever he gripped his hands around my shoulders or on my arms. After a few moments he fully got on my bed, laid himself out, and asked me to come sit on his face. 

I did so without hesitation and crawled my way up slowly lowering myself onto him. He started taking my balls into his mouth first and I moaned. His hands ran up my back and then around playing with my chest before he started licking underneath my balls and pushing me down toward his cock. I came down willingly spreading my ass on his face while I pressed down against him so I could shove his cock in my mouth. I grabbed around his legs to give myself some more leverage and started again. 

We continued like this for a few minutes and he took my cock in his mouth as well as I thrusted in and out into his throat. He held his hands around my ass and guided me in and out of him and I took him as deep as I could in my mouth while licking his shaft up and down between breaths. 

I pulled myself out of his mouth a few times having come too close to cumming but eventually he wouldn't let me out as I shot several loads into his throat and he took them all down without hesitation. He rolled me over and started jerking himself over my face until finally coating me with another layer of warm cum. 

We laid there for a few minutes taking and catching up a little since out last time until he started picking himself up. I laid there naked and coated watching him while we talked a little more. He teased each other a little back and forth about being so hard to schedule with but otherwise he left happy and looking forward to our next time. 

Cumming in N had drained me and i took a break for a bit to unwind and take in the afterglow a little while cleaning myself up. As much as I loved being covered in cum, I didn't want to make a mess. I was still chatting with a few of the guys I had missed and let them know we'd schedule for another time as it was close to 1am at this time. I noticed one last guy in my queue asking if I was free. This was T (53m).

T was a staggering 6'6"", 53yo, with a massive and thick cock and (if my former stories are any giveaway) was just my type. As exhausted as I was, I knew I'd be kicking myself for not following up with him. We exchanged some messages and pics and he commented on how much he loved my face and body till we eventually decided to make this happen. He was a little farther out and by the time he got there (after some misdirection) it was 2am. 

Feeling a little racy, I answered the door wearing only a shirt and led him in giving him a chance to get a good luck at my ass on the stairs up to my room. We talked for a long time at first and he gave some of his stories as I listened (as closely as I could). He was intimidating in person as I underestimated how bit 6'6"" was. He absolutely towered over me and I had never had this much of a heigh difference with former meetups. I was definitely distracted and flustered but did my best to pay attention all the same. 

He paused at one point and looked me up and down noticing how hard my cock was at that point and picked me up onto his lap kissing me deeply. My bare ass felt his cock pressing up onto me through his pants as I rubbed around it a little bit while kissing him back and letting him run his hands around me. He took off my shirt too completely exposing me while he still took me fully dressed in his collared shirt and jeans. I can't say I didn't love that but it felt a bit embarrassing especially with the size difference.

Without even breaking a sweat. He leaned back and guided my hips towards his mouth taking me similarly to N earlier. He licked his way around my balls and shaft as I grinded on him. I couldn't get his pants off just yet but unbuttoned and unzipped his jean and reached for his cock. I couldn't believe what I was feeling. His massive throbbing cock put anything else I had experienced to shame as I struggled to pull it out hitting it against my face a few times in the process. 

He was already leaking precum and I dug through hjs boxers some more revealing his massive balls. It just barely fit in my hand as I cupped around them feeling him up gently. I was so mesmerized I forgot to start sucking him off there for a few moments. I grabbed his balls with one hand and balanced on his thigh with the other as I licked up and down his shaft and slowly caressed the tip with me tongue. 

There was no way I could fit the whole thing down so I made my best effort and took him as deep as I could. This seemed to be good enough for him as I felt him tighten his lips around my cock while he moaned with pleasure. We continued like this for what seemed like half an hour honestly. I was able to hold it a lot longer thanks to N having taken care of me earlier. 

After some time, he rolled me over onto my back with my legs leaning all the way up against his shoulders. I panted as he spread them apart and started to press his tip against my asshole. I'm pretty sure my eyes crossed hard at this point as I could barely manage the feeling. He held my legs tight as he pressed in. Having noticed the lube on my shelf, he took some more, rubbed it on his cock and slid In ever so faster. 

It still took more than 10 minutes before I could handle all of him and at that point I was just completely mindless and let him do whatever he wanted. He thankfully continued to take me slowly and pressed my legs back going in as deep as possible. I'll never forget the feeling of his massive balls slamming against mine with each thrust. 

I can barely recall the details past this point but I had cum without him even touching my cock at one point from the sheer feeling of him inside me and after having plowed me for however long he did, he finished my cumming deep inside me. 

I laid there completely out of it at this point while his cum leaked out of me. He laid down beside me as he continued to talk and took some more lube and began to stroke me. I held his arm close against my waist while he made slow motions having already been overwhelmed from earlier. 

It must've been another 20 minutes of him stroking me before I came whatever was left into his hands. He made me lick it off his fingers at this point before gathering himself, saying his goodbyes, and making his way back down.

I didn't hate him, but I did think he was a hypocrite about almost every stance he takes. I also disliked a lot of  the Blue Stripes, and the fact that he hand-selected them and says they were like family didn't make me like him more. I do admit that I played his route second, and while I didn't rush through I definitely didn't spend quite as much time on it since I played both routes back to back. I could have missed something.

rzsef6,"I think I started my period quite early. I was probably 10. It was quiet low in the beginning so it was easy to hide it. I had heard about bleeding and pads from my friend at school but I didn‚Äôt know if she was lying or not. 

My family was never open about these things so I wouldn‚Äôt have the courage to go and say: ‚Äúhey mom! I‚Äôm bleeding down there. Could you help me?‚Äù Or anything like that.

My mother didn‚Äôt find out probably until months later. And when she did, she demanded me to show her my underwear. In a very controlling and intimidating way. I was so nervous and uncomfortable that I think I tried to avoid it as much as I could. But I eventually had to show her my _crime scene_. She then gave me a brief talk that girls bleed once a month and it takes 3/5/7 days at a time. She also gave me homemade pads. She‚Äôd cut and fold washed old clothes. They were big, chunky and uncomfortable. They also didn‚Äôt have wings so they‚Äôd consistently leak, and I‚Äôd be shamed and blamed for staining the sheets and what not. We weren‚Äôt poor or anything, but my parents were always tight with money when it came to anything I wanted/needed. Partly because they had a hard life and money never came easy and partly because that‚Äôs what they‚Äôd seen from their parents and maybe they were also being environmental. None would justify their abuse anyway.

I just remembered this today as my period is about to start and I thought I‚Äôd ask to see what everyone else‚Äôs experience was?

Edit: one thing she taught me was how to keep this absolutely a secret from males, i.e. my father and my brother. Later on she‚Äôd buy pads but it all had to be in black bags and I also had to make sure to put my pads in a separate bag and dispose it discreetly so the males at home wouldn‚Äôt find out. I still don‚Äôt understand the logic behind that. My brother is a decade older than me.

# Edit 2: This post is NOT for women/girls only. I would like to hear the stories from men/boys of the groups as well.

Edit 3: I just remembered another episode. I was in high school and so was another relative‚Äôs son who was one or two years older than me. His parents were either too irresponsible or too open minded or a combination of both. One day I heard his mother having a casual chat with my mother and telling her how she‚Äôs been telling her son to ‚Äúwatch his interactions‚Äù and be careful with HIV and what not. I was shocked to hear that and I kept wondering if that means that she know and she‚Äôs ok with letting her som have sex?! He took his life a few years ago or overdosed on drugs or something but that‚Äôs another story. 

Edit 4: I‚Äôm reading all your comments even if I don‚Äôt get to reply to each of them, and I‚Äôm quietly crying for all of us who have had to go through all this stuff that we have. I wish we could somehow support each other in a better way than this. I‚Äôm really saddened to know that there have been so many of us from all corners of the world that have gone through a tough phase of our lives all by ourselves, with as much neglect as we could get from some random humans who called themselves parents.",Did your Nparents ever teach you about puberty and/or sex?,2.0,2.0

sd4eho,"Hi! I came across NOS4A2 and just finished watching it - such a great show! I had a few questions and was wondering if anyone had answers.

1. What do the lights flickering, the radio making noises, etc. mean? Do the abilities of Strong Creatives have something to do with energy and it's this energy that disrupts the ""normal"" functioning of these objects somehow? 

2. What does the static mean? Does static happen when the real world and the world of thought intersect?

3. When Jolene takes Vic to her Inscape, they temporarily leave their bodies to go astral project in the real world. During this, their actual bodies lie on the floor and their eyes show static. They come back, have a chat, and then the very last scene with Jolene takes place. In this scene, is her physical body dead? If her physical body died, why would there be static in her eyes? Is her physical body still alive, and the reason her eyes are static is because she chose to permanently astral project forever via her Inscape? This means her body is in a comatose or brain dead (or something) state, right? Is she now a ghost then, immortal, unable to die? What does the afterlife even mean in this NOS4A2 universe? Is her soul floating around in the real world and will never be able to crossover?

4. When Charlie drives children to Christmasland, they travel along a long snowy road lined with trees. On the sides of this road, we see a scary animated snowman, a sinewy scary reindeer, etc. These don't exist in the real world, so does that mean the entire road, trees, the landscape, AND Christmasland are all Charlie's Inscape? That his Inscape is actually quite massive? Or does the Wraith start driving in the real world and then slowly, kilometer by kilometer, more of the real world fades and more of the Inscape is present (e.g. the road with the scary deer, etc.) cumulating to Christmasland? I.e. they drive from 100% real world, to X kilometers later 90% real world, 10% Inscape, to X kilometers later 80% real world, 20% inscape, etc. until 100% Inscape at Christmasland's doors? Maybe I'm overthinking it.

5. Does Charlie Manx actually, truly believe that abducting children, sucking their life essence, turning them into vampires, and trapping them in Christmasland is really saving these children from their bad parents, protecting their innocence, etc.? Does he really not understand that what he's doing is terrible?

6. If the opening of Maggie's scrabble bag (which is both her Knife and her Inscape) was big enough to peer inside, maybe even walk into, what would we see? Just scrabble tiles? Charlie figures out some characteristics of Vic early on (like her wanting to travel, get away from her circumstances, etc.) by just knowing that her Inscape is a bridge. What does Maggie's Inscape say about her?

7. In S1E8 when Bing captures Vic after her RISD acceptance party, he gases her in his basement and makes her say the exact lines his Mum once told him. Given that he violated his Mum, does this mean Bing did the same to Vic? When Vic woke up, she was still fully clothed, but there was a Vaseline jar beside her... I didn't see that jar in any of the scenes before - but after she woke up, the scenes kept showing the Vaseline in the background.",Questions about NOS4A2,2.0,2.0
s6wkl2,"I'm selling a 2005 Honda on eBay in the US specifically PA. The buyer said I can go to the title place on my own and get the title signed and a bill of sale notarized. This makes no sense to me but maybe I'm missing something. 

His explanation is that he wants to buy the car but isn't ready to fully transfer the title and wants to move the car to a used car dealership for storage. He intends to give the car to his daughter and doesn't want to pay the insurance for the month before she gets her license.

My understanding is that I'm completely liable for the car while it's ""in limbo"" regardless of having a bill of sale. He claims he also has dealer tags to move the car. 

I think he's trying to title jump and resell the car but it's just a hunch. When I tell him things seem off he tells me I'm being difficult and that he's done this hundreds of times. I thought PA needed both people present for a transfer and I've always done it this way.

I had a chance to call my local title place and they said it seemed off. I'm going to get a hold of my insurance and see what they think today.

Lots of other things seem off about his story but I'm going to give him the benefit of the doubt for anything not involving the legal stuff.

Update: Told the guy I need the title transfer finalized and he went completely dark (he's been incredibly prompt until this point).

Update 2: Buyer got aggressive with me when I told him I decide how the sale happens and we were doing it my way. Then changed his story to say he didn't need the car for several months instead of one.

Update 3: Refunded buyer, put the car out with a ""For Sale"" sign, it sold same day for what I was asking.","Weird situation selling privately. Buyer wants title signed but wants to ""hold"" the title to avoid insurance costs for a month.",2.0,2.0

rvy1bs,"TL;DR My petty revenge is becoming the slut he wanted (more than he wanted a loving relationship with me) out in the open, without him.

He damaged our relationship with his cheating kink - starting fights with me to go hookup with strangers, and devaluing me for not being slutty enough. 

He loves looking at sluts, which isn‚Äôt the problem - we could have enjoyed them together. Problem was‚Ä¶ he didn‚Äôt look at me. I couldn‚Äôt compete with the infinite pornography content and the super hot creators. He couldn‚Äôt reassure me, wouldn‚Äôt communicate, didn‚Äôt prioritize our real world relationship.

He wanted to have this secret double life - He‚Äôd spend hours every day browsing Reddit and porn sites, cruising for chat buddies, looking for hookup opportunities. 

He didn‚Äôt include me. 

So I decided to become an online slut like the ones he always chose over me. I figured if he gives his attention to others, I‚Äôm entitled to get attention FROM others. 

I started a porn profile on Reddit. I post pictures, stories... even guidelines for how to become one of my playmates. I play into his kinks and I portray myself like the girls and guys he craves.

Only‚Ä¶ now that he knows, he hates me. It‚Äôs gross when I do it. He doesn‚Äôt love this version of me. He can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôd stoop this low. He doesn‚Äôt want anything to do with me. 

But that‚Äôs not where my petty revenge stops. I‚Äôm actually enjoying being a slut on Reddit. I‚Äôm exploring my sexuality, trying kinks and fetishes. Right out in the open, where he can see what having me as a kinky partner could have looked like. 

His response? Degrade me, reject me, eradicate me from his life. Because I became the kind of slut he always chose over me. And I didn‚Äôt include him. 

Boom.

Edit: looking for playmates does not mean I‚Äôm out fucking around. No hooking up! I‚Äôm being slutty online. I take my sexual health seriously.

Edit #2: it's inaccurate to say I've become the kind of slut he likes... I'm still not kinky enough, or as easily accessible. And the hotness factor is debatable. I've seen some of the partners he's chosen over me and let's just say they make me look like Mrs. America.","He gave his attention away, now I‚Äôm letting others give me attention",2.0,2.0

A manager isn't your mum and the owner isn't your dad, if there is a problem they should be happy to work WITH you on fixing it. It should be everyone vs the problem, not them vs you.



I used to work for Aldi. I was told I no longer had to seek tasks from managers as I was experienced enough to time manage myself. 

I was on tills and closed my till in the correct order and went to do other tasks, this apparently 'upset' the manager who was on the till ahead of me as I didn't immediately interrupt her serving a customer to ask her what to do/for a task. 

I'd been there 3 years, I knew what had to be done.l and when. 

I suppose she didn't like that it didn't give her the opportunity to swap with me and get off tills herself, despite it not being her turn.

Many managers would not do tills, despite it being as much a part of their jobs as ours. 

She didn't tell me at all this upset her, instead she asked me to go on priority till for 'just an hour to cover breaks' and, not knowing her motives, I agreed happily as that's the job. 

7 HOURS LATER, I am still on priority till and no one cared. I approached my manager and said I thought the communication and task assignment wasnt clear and unbalanced. This is when she revealed she left me on tills to PUNISH me for not doing something I was told not to do! 

I quit on the spot, told her off and filed a complaint against the her. 

I stated that if I had not confronted her, she wouldn't have said anything at all, so the act of Punishment was an abuse of power for a perceived personal slight and she had no intention to teach me to avoid such 'slights' in the future. That if she did this to me so easily, she has most likely done it before. 

I never heard anything back and no one followed up.

The regional manager also tacitly tried to accuse me of abusing sick leave as annual leave, I very quickly shut him the fuck up by reminding him that doctors certs were given EVERY time (Costing me money and hours of waiting time every time) and if he's so concerned about my health, he should do something about the understaffing and unsafe conditions. 



You are there to do a job, not to be instilled with some group think philosophy or be demanded to confirm your entire personality to them. Your mind and ideology is yours and isn't for sale or open to being negotiated.

s8g1rz,"I had low expectations going into The Thing \[2011\] because of how ""awful"" the movie is, with the hideous CGI, terrible dialogue, and basically the same plot as John Carpenter's, but I found that these points were over-dramatized and weren't as bad as most people say they are.

The CGI wasn't *that* bad and didn't affect my experience at all, although I do think that they should've stuck with practical effects, which sadly they didn't. I'm sure the producers chose to use CGI instead as it's more 'modern' and 'new' and probably thought it would be better for sales, and I'm sure they would've been right if they didn't force it at the last minute.

The dialogue was okay, but sometimes felt forced. I also felt that a lot of the characters weren't very well included and were just there to fill in the slots from what was said in the original The Thing. Regarding the plot, there wasn't very much they could change, but to me I felt it was different from John Carpenters, with the new 'test', exploring the ship, and many more small things. Sure people are right when they say that this prequel was ""unnecessary"" since it would basically just be the same thing, (no pun intended) but I'm glad this was made so we could get a look at what happened over at the Norwegian's base.

Another thing I'd like to note: I couldn't help but smile when I saw the shot of the helicopter following the dog, the inclusion of this credits scene really made the movie for me.

s8mgzp,"Yes, I am a boomer, a late boomer. The idea that we had it easy early on is correct. I do not have a degree, but went to a 2 year trade school and learned electronics. My first job out of school was working for a large international corporation making $14 an hour, about $30 in todays money. In the early 90's the company I worked for wanted us to train an outside company to take over our work. We rebelled and were told in no uncertain terms to do it or we would be fired immediately. We complied, but I knew my days there were numbered. I left that company and became a subcontractor installing and servicing the equipment I had been working on in the field. The work involved extensive travel and ridiculous hours, but paid very well. For an installation we had to work 24 hours straight. From noon to noon. However a full installation payed $2500. By the late 90's I was making $70K after taxes, about $115K now. Then the clients we were installing for started to balk about all the money they were spending, which was about $3500 to install a $65K system. The nickel and diming began. Instead of flat rate, with us covering all expenses and guaranteeing our work they started to pay piecemeal. So much for a cable, terminal, etc. By the early 2000's there were no more subcontracting jobs, only employees. By 2005 I was making $35K as the employee of a company doing more work than I did in 1995. As a subcontractor I set my own schedule for availability and worked about 40 hours a week, but had many free days. By 2005 I was working 80-100 hours a week for that $35K. In the end I had to leave that sector and find something else. The struggle is real, the continuing funneling of our labor gains up the ladder has been going on for a long time, and frankly, even though I knew it was happening, there wasn't anything I could do to stop it. Don't give up, keep pushing and refuse to be exploited. Maybe finally we can get some kind of fairness, although at this point I do want to see justice.",My experience working as a boomer.,2.0,2.0

ryy86x,"I just walked past my local train station and there was a crowd of football fans yelling abuse at a line of 50 or more police officers. There were police vans backed up along the high street, and I don't doubt that there were more police stationed all along the route. Not such a rare occurrence (I do live near a particularly notorious football club to be fair), but [I checked](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-45837613) and apparently the cost of providing police to stop these twats from killing each other / smashing up the place falls [squarely on the taxpayer](https://www.itv.com/news/london/2017-11-10/exclusive-true-cost-of-policing-football-in-the-capital-revealed).

Football clubs are multi-million pound profit machines - how can it be OK for them not to pay for the huge costs incurred? Why should they get away with causing all this disruption and making the rest of us foot the bill?

EDIT: A lot of people are saying that in Manchester the clubs do pay for the police at train stations and such. Can anyone can point me to a source on that? So far everything I've read (including quotes from senior GMP officers) says otherwise.

FURTHER EDIT: Thanks to [u/EricUtd1878](https://www.reddit.com/u/EricUtd1878/) for posting this link which pretty confirms what they're saying [https://www.skysports.com/football/news/2788817/wigan-anger-at-police-bill](https://www.skysports.com/football/news/2788817/wigan-anger-at-police-bill)

BTW: I didn't mention it but the football club in question is Millwall. Most of the time the supporters are fine (family atmosphere and all that), but it seems when it's a bitter rival we get trouble.

For the record, it's not the policing inside the stadium that I'm talking about, but the extra police swarming around my local area every time Millwall plays someone tasty.

First of all Thank You for deciding to finally add a scoreboard but I would like to point out that hiding death count makes it harder for us to spot cheaters. Say XXXX\_Pro\_gAmer has 100 kills and is at the top of the scoreboard, How can we know if he is going 100 /  90 deaths or 100 / 0 deaths. It matters alot to identify cheaters.  


Also, Please separate Enemy team and my team in the scoreboard. If you can't fit all of this info horizontally then maybe arrange them top to bottom where on top you can see your team and by scrolling you can see the enemy team.

Or you can reduce the space between the stats and fit the enemy team on the right.

Or you can add a Button on the top which says enemy team and if you click it , it turns the scoreboard into enemy team's and if you click on it again , You are taken back to your team's scoreboard.

Right now certain facilities require proof of vaccination.   Would those who refuse the vaccine agree to be registered as ""refusing the vaccine"" if that meant they had the same access and privileges to locations and events as the vaccinated, if in exchange they agreed that they would not seek (and could be refused) professional medical services if they become ill with COVID-19?

**UPDATE:  Thank you all who participated.  A few things:**

This was never a suggestion on policy or legislation.  It was a question for the unvaccinated.  My goal was to get more insight into their decision and the motivations behind it.  In particular, I was trying to understand if most of them had done reflection on their decisions and had a strong mental and moral conviction to their decision.  Likewise, I was curious to see how many had made the decision on purely emotional grounds and had not really explored their own motivation.

For those who answered yes - I may not agree with your reasoning but I do respect that you have put the thought into your decision and have agreed (theoretically) to accept consequences for your decision.

For those who immediately went to whatabout-ism (obesity, alcohol, smoking, etc) - I am assuming your choice is on the emotional spectrum and honest discourse on your resolve is uncomfortable.  I understand how emotions can drive some people, so it is good to understand just how many fall under this classification.

It would have been nice if there had been an opportunity for more discussion on the actual question.  I think there is much to be gained by understanding where those who make different decisions are coming from and the goal of the question was to present a hypothetical designed to trigger reflection.

Meanwhile Toxic tears video is much more somber, she‚Äôs in a awful place mentally. She‚Äôs currently staying in a drafty studio where she films her videos ( paid for by Jake) and she talks about the hardships she‚Äôs going through besides the breakup. And she says she is cold and wants to go home. I just find it interesting how different the videos are to each other, Jake seems fine and ready to work on new things and toxic is just struggling with it all.


Edit: Jake has deleted the video I‚Äôm talking about in the post. There are also rumors that says Jake cheated on Toxic tears with her tattoo artist and he is now in Barcelona, deleting everything that has to do with him and Toxic Tears.",Toxic Tears and Jake Munro breakup: it‚Äôs like night and day,2.0,2.0

s9dxct,"This is a 15 YO kid who's had a bit of a rough road because his dad's a dick.  But now he lives with his Mom, and he got the Quest 2 he wanted more than anything for Christmas.  Also, I teamed up with Grampa and guided him through Steam to buy the kid Half-Life Alyx.  So, the system he wanted most, and the game he wanted most; and then I got him a metal model kit of the Terminator T-800 endoskeleton.

THEN Mom found out there's a browser on the Oculus, and no parental controls.  Into a sack it went, and that into her closet, until she can ""figure out how to set up a DNS"".  He hadn't even managed to install Alyx on it yet, and now all he's got is a metal model kit of the Terminator T-800 endoskeleton.

Now, I knew the DNS thing wasn't going to happen for a while, with her work schedule the way it is and the fact that she would have to bang her head against it to figure it out even more than I would.  I had joked with the kid when he got the Quest that I was going to figure out how to get him grounded so I could play with it.  Now I DO have it and just feel awful for the kid.

Of course, once I got home I realized I wasn't going to be able to do much about the DNS thing without their router in front of me.  I've done some research, but it's something I've never had to do before and I don't have their hardware to experiment with; but I figured if I could do it on *my* router, I should be able to repeat the process over there with just a bit more research on their hardware.  So, thing 1) I'm looking for, is a good guide on how to pull that off; my first googles gave me *so* much information that I just felt lost, and narrowing it down a bit would help a LOT.

The other thing I read about was that user-made mod that eliminates the Facebook login requirement (which is as it should be anyway IMO) because AIUI that kills the browser (and the store too).  This could be an option, but my concerns there are:

A) Could I brick this thing?

B)  Is that going to satisfy Mom, or is an industrious, curious teenager going to just install Firefox and laugh?

I've mentioned the app that would allow her to watch what he's doing, but that's not good enough.  I might be able to get her to accept that as part of a pack of methods, tho'.

So, anyway, any advice from those who have walked this road would be greatly appreciated.  While I wait I was thinking I might load up Half Life Alyx and play with that, then I remembered the kid told me he doesn't even have a pair of tweezers to put together his metal model kit of the Terminator T-800 endoskeleton.",Trying to Mom-proof my nephew's Oculus,2.0,2.0

s9fpr0,"Yesterday I made a kind of pole on reddit about who to fuck while my bf was at work.
The options were: 
1. Wait for my bf
2. A fwb
3. One of bf‚Äôs friends
4. Random from tinder
5. A guy I hate.

Well most people wanted me to fuck the guy I hate. And ofc I stayed true to reddit so I texted him. As soon as I sent it I knew it was gonna be unbearable. He started gloating about how I already needed more since the blowjob the day before. And how much I must have loved his big cock. 

I hate him so much. 

I asked to to leave it. And just get over and fuck me. He told me he‚Äôd be there in 30 minutes and I should be naked when he arrived. 
I obliged and when I heard knocking I went completely naked to let him in. 

He kept talking about how long he has wanted to fuck me. And how he‚Äôd make me cum over and over while groping my tits. I had my back to him so he couldn‚Äôt see me rolling my eyes at him. 

But I also must admit there is something really hot about having this fucking idiot groping me. Like.. I he must know that I hate him by now. So ofc he thinks it‚Äôs about his big cock. Which btw is big but not as big as you‚Äôd think considering how much he talked about it. 

He started fingering me telling me how wet I was for him while grinding on my ass. I just answered ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù. I really wanted him to know how much I hate him. Idk why. 

He went on about how lucky my bf is to get to grope those tiddies every day. 

He then dragged me to our bedroom and threw me on the bed. As I lays there I started playing with my tits as he stood in front of me calling me a slut while opening his pants. I could tell he was already hard. Soon enough he pulled his boxers off and freed his big hard cock. He got into bed with me and got on top as he sucked on my nipples and played with my pussy. I‚Äôm pretty loud in bed and I just couldn‚Äôt stop moaning and this made everything worse as this dickhead kept gloating about how bad I wanted his cock while my bf was gone. I didn‚Äôt really have time to respond cause then he put his hard cock up to my pussy and pressed it inside me. I felt my tight pussy grip around his cock as he slowly started thrusting in me. When he got almost all of his cock inside me he fucked me harder while groping my tits and telling me what a slut I am and how much I love his cock. I still hate that but I couldn‚Äôt really disagree at this point. As I was close to cumming he took a firm grip around my throat and asked whose slut I was. I was so close so I just went with it 
- ‚ÄúI‚Äôm your fucking slut! Please fuck me, please!‚Äù 
- ‚ÄúMm you really love my big cuck don‚Äôt you?‚Äù 
- ‚Äúyes! Fuck yes, I love your big cock in me! Oh my fucking god!!‚Äù 

I started shaking and had no control over my body as I came on his cock. 

After this he turned me around so I was in doggy. He told me to move my ass like the slut I am. As he put his cock in me I started grinding my ass against him as I could hear him moan. I dealt both his hands on my ass as I moved it back and forth the best I‚Äôve learned. 
Soon enough I started feeling a finger near my ass. He asked me how I felt about it. At this point I was so horny and my bf had fucked me in the ass earlier so I told him I love it. I guess he got the answer he was looking for cause sure enough I had a finger in my ass seconds later. I moaned later as I still moved my grinded on his dick while he now fingered my ass. He took this as a positive response and added one more finger. 

-‚Äú fuck you‚Äôre such a slut! I‚Äôm gonna fuck your ass okay?‚Äù 
-‚Äú yes! Yea. Whatever you want!‚Äù 
-‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna fuck your ass with my big cock while your bf is at work‚Äù 

This was the last I heard cause I lost my mind as something bigger (maybe just more fingers) entered my ass. I loved the felling of being filled up in both holes and I lost control again as the second orgasmed rushed through me. 

He then took out his cock and pointed it at my ass. He didn‚Äôt take much time and pretty much just shoved it in there. I had his hands on my ass and pulled me towards him every time he thrusted in my ass. He fucked me as hard as he could and I screamed in pleasure by now. 

Not long after he pulled out and started jerking his cock as he told me to get on my knees. I did as commanded and sat on my knees tongue out presenting my big tits so he could shoot his cum all over me and make me look like a true slut. He did just that and glazed me face and tongue in a huge load of cum. It dripped down to my tits as I sat there thinking about what just happened. He grabbed his phone asking if he could take a pic. I said no and he looked pretty disapointed. Never the less he put on his clothes and I let him out the apartment still naked. He smacked my ass once more as he left. 

From that moment he has been completely insufferable! Texting me all the time. How much I loved his cock and how tight my ass was. Keeps mocking me and making hints to everything that happened. Bottom line: still hate the fucking loser.",(20f) i let a guy i hate fuck me (While my bf was at work.) because of reddit,1.0,1.0
sb71bw,"I‚Äôll say for some cases but not all. 

Usually there‚Äôs two type of friendzoning:

Realizing someone you thought of as a close friend only wanted to get with you feels really uncomfortable. Like when you think someone is just genuinely nice and cares about you, only to realize they were nice because they wanted more‚Ä¶ and then they treat you different after because you won‚Äôt give them what they want. It sucks and it hurts when someone completely cuts you off because you don‚Äôt want to sleep with them so you‚Äôre not worth their time anymore

Or when you care about someone who cares about you and you have to turn them down because you don‚Äôt feel the same, there‚Äôs such immense guilt because as some point you wish you COULD feel that way so you don‚Äôt hurt them but you just can‚Äôt. It changes an entire relationship. I still feel guilty about times I‚Äôve had to respectfully say I‚Äôm not interested in a relationship with a person. 

People always get mad/hurt about being friendzoned and act like the person was purposely trying to make them feel bad but that‚Äôs not true. Just because someone wants to be your friend and not more doesn‚Äôt make them a shitty person. Having to see the disappointment when someone puts themselves out there is hard, especially when they‚Äôre a close friend. I‚Äôve been on both sides and honestly, both hurt just as bad. 

And before anyone says ‚Äúif you feel bad just date them‚Äù, lying about your feelings to someone to make them feel better for a short period just to break their heart later is worse than being honest",Friendzoning someone is just as hard as being friendzoned,2.0,2.0

Men face [longer prison sentences for the exact same crime](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2144002). They are more likely to be [shot to death by police](https://www.statista.com/statistics/585149/people-shot-to-death-by-us-police-by-gender/), to be [homeless](https://www.statista.com/statistics/962171/share-homeless-people-us-gender/), to be [murdered](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/vio.2017.0016), and to be [suicidal](https://www.statista.com/statistics/187478/death-rate-from-suicide-in-the-us-by-gender-since-1950/). Men [work longer hours](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/06/12/fathers-day-facts/ft_18-05-01_fathersday_time/) even when unpaid work is considered and are more likely to [die on the job](https://www.statista.com/statistics/187127/number-of-occupational-injury-deaths-in-the-us-by-gender-since-2003/) than women, and even though they earn more money, women are responsible for the majority of [consumer spending decisions](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228926737_The_Female_Economy) and reap more in [tax benefits](https://motoristoppression.wordpress.com/2016/11/03/32/) than do men. In some countries, men are forced into [gender-based conscription](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/12/08/lawmakers-kill-provision-requiring-women-register-draft/6433960001/). Boys get [lower grades](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-31751672) for doing the same exact work as girls, and young men [enroll in college](https://www.statista.com/statistics/236360/undergraduate-enrollment-in-us-by-gender/) at a much lower rate than women. Men are also not protected from [domestic violence](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233717660_Thirty_Years_of_Denying_the_Evidence_on_Gender_Symmetry_in_Partner_Violence_Implications_for_Prevention_and_Treatment), despite research showing that [domestic violence](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261543769_References_Examining_Assaults_by_Women_on_Their_Spouses_or_Male_Partners_An_Updated_Annotated_Bibliography) directed at men is at least as, if not more common, than domestic violence directed at women. Boys are not protected from [genital mutilation](https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/circumcision-rates-by-state), and are more likely to be [undernourished](https://gh.bmj.com/content/5/12/e004030), worldwide. Despite the fact that men are [raped and sexually assaulted](https://np.reddit.com/r/FeMRADebates/comments/qlrday/comment/hj7nuoe/) at alarmingly high rates (mostly by women, contrary to popular belief), they are not adequately protected. Men are also vulnerable to [false allegations](https://imgur.com/a/80BOyfS) of sexual violence, and they face discrimination in the [rental housing market](https://np.reddit.com/r/Male_Studies/comments/rspfj8/ethnic_and_gender_discrimination_in_the_rental/) and in [family courts](https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10118128/). They have poorer health outcomes, a [lower life satisfaction](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/08-gender-and-well-being-graham.pdf) and a shorter [life expectancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_life_expectancy) than women, and yet [resources continue to be directed disproportionately toward women](https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2012-06-25/male-health-initiatives-get-less-money-than-those-aimed-at-women). Despite all these findings (and more), male problems do not appear to attract much attention. Why? Because, for evolutionary reasons, humans are less prone to respond with **empathy** to men and boys than to women and girls. In this four-part series of posts, I'll present a substantial amount of evidence to demonstrate both the causes and implications of the **gender empathy gap**. Be aware that some of it is quite disturbing, so make sure you are in the right state of mind before you begin reading.

First, I recommend watching this fantastic video for an illustrated introduction to the subject, which all-too-painfully demonstrates the existence of the empathy gap with tangible and shocking evidence: [ICMI20: Eccentrik Hat - ""Why Men Need Help And Why Feminism Won't Help Them""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwXrFedCW0U)

You may also find [MANNdat's interview of Dr. Warren Farrell on the lack of empathy towards men](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NE7ZGqaElCc) interesting, or his guest post [The Gender Gap in Empathy ‚Äî A path to ending the gender war?](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/how-do-life/202004/the-gender-gap-in-empathy) on PsychologyToday [or the same post on genderempathygap.de](https://genderempathygap.de/the-gender-gap-in-empathy/).

Let us start by quoting some excerpts from [The Male Gender Empathy Gap: Time for psychology to take action (Seager et al., 2016)](https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1534129/) because I think they made an excellent point:
> Whether we like it or not, there are different patterns and expectations relating to the expression of distress in males and females. This means that **male distress is often overlooked, or seen simply as bad behavior so that male distress is, in effect, invisible**.
> 
> \[The\] archetypal ‚Äúmale gender script‚Äù \[‚Ä¶\] has been described by Seager, Sullivan & Barry (2014a) as an evolutionary and universal pressure on men defining how they must live to be a successful male. This script consists of three main rules:
> 1. Be a fighter and a winner
> 2. Be a provider and a protector
 >3. Retain mastery and control over one‚Äôs feelings
> 
> Farrell and Gray (book in preparation) talk about this in terms of ‚Äúsocial bribes‚Äù. According to this proposition, social groups across the human species have survived more effectively because males have evolved collectively to protect them. The success of all societies historically has therefore been built upon the blood, sweat and tears of men, sacrificing their lives in wars to preserve the freedom of all and risking their lives to build the infrastructure of civilization. Working class men in particular have been expected by virtue of their gender to die in tunnels, on tall buildings, down mines and on the high seas, supplying the buildings, transport, food supplies and security that create the comfort of a civilized life for all. **Across the ages, men have been ‚Äúsocially bribed‚Äù into behaving this way by the honour and social approval of their tribe or society.** In this way men (and some women) have been afforded the status of heroes because of their strength or courage. At the same time, men (but not usually women) have equally been ‚Äúshamed‚Äù to the extent that they do not conform to this pattern. There is no greater illustration of this than the white feathers that were handed out as a symbol of cowardice to men in the UK who would not fight for their country. In our modern society, it may now be that the shame factor is growing greater for men as the opportunity to achieve heroic status is being reduced. It is for this reason that Farrell and Gray talk about the urgent need to help our boys in the future switch from ‚Äòheroic intelligence‚Äô to ‚Äòhealth intelligence‚Äô (see below). Equally, **there is a need for all of us in society to tune in more to male emotional language.** Rather than simply expecting men to talk differently we need to be **listening** differently to them. **Men reflexively ‚Äî perhaps instinctively ‚Äî hide vulnerability even under changing social, economic and political circumstances that are arguably generating more distress.** To reveal **vulnerability or failure of any kind can be deeply shaming for a man**. Because of such pressures we do not register male vulnerability and we all become less comfortable with the notion of males in need. This means that distressed men end up looking less like honourable victims and more like losers, criminals or even idiots.
> 
> \[‚Ä¶\]
> 
> So even when we do acknowledge publicly that men across the globe commit suicide at a much higher rate than women (nearly 4 times more in the UK), this still does not elicit our compassion. **If anything, we switch off.** In the same way we don‚Äôt really acknowledge or care that men account for a massive 97% of deaths at work in the UK InsideMan (2015) and 86% of people sleeping rough in England (Department for Communities and Local Government , 2016). When it comes to gender equality we only really think of women as beings legitimate victims and as having any cause for complaint. In the UK we still have a minister for ‚Äòwomen and inequalities‚Äô as if the two issues were intrinsically linked. **Ironically, therefore, what looks like a serious attempt to challenge gender prejudice towards women has the unintended consequence of reinforcing gender prejudice towards men.**
> 
> \[‚Ä¶\]
> 
> So there are deep rooted reasons why people don‚Äôt feel as much empathy for men as they do for women. **Men have evolved to be [disposable](https://twitter.com/Waters4Congress/status/1466598242511036421)**, being there to put their bodies on the line, to offer protection, not receive it. So a man in trouble evokes less sympathy than a woman or a child. This might help explain why men, when they are looking for sympathy from the judicial system, are six times more likely than a woman to get a conviction for an identical crime (Bradford, 2015). And **rather than sympathise with men over a possible inequality, our immediate social perception is that men must be six times more troublesome or else six times less in need of protection** from the prison system. Similarly, boys are more likely than girls to fail in school (Stoet & Geary, 2015), but **rather than address this as a gender inequality, we are unsympathetic, often perceiving boys as disruptive and lazy.** When couples who have children break up, fathers are still much less likely to get custody of children (Cancian et al, 2014), but **rather than rush to address this as another possible inequality we assume that fathers don‚Äôt miss their children like mothers do, and that children need their mothers more than their fathers**. The absent father is something that we have all been programmed to expect and tolerate. In fact we are tolerant of male suffering, or blind to it, in many other areas too, for example, violence by women against men is as widespread as violence by men against women (Straus, 2010) but violence against men attracts less attention.
> 
> \[‚Ä¶\]
> 
> As a profession that cares about human suffering, why are we \[psychologists\] not more alert to the signs all around us of the problems facing males, such as suicide? It seems quite likely that like the rest of society we are suffering from a type of blindness ‚Äì **male gender blindness** (Seager et al, 2014b; Russ et al, 2015) ‚Äì which makes it difficult for us to recognize the importance of this great elephant in the room of psychology. Similarly, we appear to be susceptible to the same collective **‚Äòempathy gap‚Äô** as the rest of society when it comes to men‚Äôs issues. **Simple psychological experiments can show hard evidence of significant differences in our attitudes to the male and female genders.** For example, there are many vivid demonstrations in field experiments showing that members of the public immediately rush to help female victims of violence from a man, but turn a blind eye or even laugh when a man is the victim of the same level of force (e.g. ManKind Initiative, 2014 ‚Äì see video link below). **In social psychology, just about the only group identity that does not elicit in-group-favoritism is male identity (Rudman & Goodwin, 2004)**. As psychologists, it should be extremely interesting that we have such different responses to the two complementary halves of the human race. It is hard to imagine a more central concern for psychological science and investigation.
> 
> \[‚Ä¶\]

> **The world is forever turning, and future generations of psychologists will look back in wonder at how concern for the wellbeing of men and boys has remained in the doldrums for so long.** Our challenge to you as readers is to be among the first of a new generation of psychologists to take action, and to make men‚Äôs issues ‚Äì as part of the human condition - visible. \[‚Ä¶\] Sometimes we need reminding that [mental health interventions for men, and recognising the problems facing boys] are linked e.g. when you pass a homeless man in the street, or see a man behaving badly, it‚Äôs easy to forget that he was once somebody‚Äôs little boy.

# Male Disposability

**Quoting Dr. Warren Farrell from one of his video interviews:**
> We've historically trained boys and men to die so that all the rest of us could survive. And it's harder to become psychologically attached to someone that you may soon lose, especially if your own survival is dependent on men's willingness to die. \[‚Ä¶\] Regarding a boy as a hero is a social bribe that we created; a social bribe for that boy to be disposable. \[‚Ä¶\] Love is blind enough for him to never acknowledge that a woman who falls in love with the officer and a gentleman is attaching her love in part to his potential disposability. \[‚Ä¶\] For parents raising a daughter meant caring about her safety but raising a boy meant being caught between a parental rock and a hard place. We wanted our son to be safe, for sure, but we also wanted to feel proud that he served his country in time of war. So whether as a soldier, a firefighter or another first responder we give social bribes for young men to die; why? So that his potential for death might increase our potential for life.

In this YouTube video [GUYS vs GIRLS Homeless Experiment | Who will you help? (channel: Karim Jovian)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmC4ikxT4v4), a man and a woman of comparable age and attractiveness pretend to be homeless. While the woman gets a ton of help, the man is not even noticed by bypassers and in those rare instances that he is, he gets told he is ""lazy"" and to ""find some work or die"".

In one study that examined the trolley dilemma titled [Moral Chivalry: Gender and Harm Sensitivity Predict Costly Altruism (FeldmanHall et al. 2016)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1948550616647448), **""88% of participants reported that they would push \[a\] man off the footbridge instead \[of a woman\]""**, that is 7 1/3 times as many people would rather sacrifice a man than a woman. The same study also found that **""\[p\]articipants kept significantly less money when interacting with a female target than a male target"" to save them from harm**. See specifically [figure 1](https://journals.sagepub.com/na101/home/literatum/publisher/sage/journals/content/sppa/2016/sppa_7_6/1948550616647448/20170109/images/large/10.1177_1948550616647448-fig1.jpeg) which also confirms that women were more biased than men. Do not be confused by males' higher willingness of throwing off a female than a male bystander in this figure, as he is much less likely to throw her off in the first place, and the difference is small enough to constitute chance.

In [The Moral Machine experiment (Awad et al., 2018)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0637-6) it was shown that **both men and women were more inclined to save the lives of women over those of men**.

According to this [nytimes.com](https://www.nytimes.com) article [A Hamas surprise: Women secure victory (Ian Fisher, 2006)](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/03/world/africa/03iht-hamas.html):
> She is Mariam Farhat, the mother of three Hamas advocates killed by Israelis. She bade one son goodbye in a homemade videotape before he stormed an Israeli settlement, killing five people before he was killed. **A comment she made later received wide publicity: She said that she wished she had 100 sons to sacrifice that way.** Known as the ""mother of martyrs,"" she is seen in a campaign video carrying a gun.
> [‚Ä¶]
> Now she is one of the six women elected as Hamas legislators. **The election rules included quotas for women for all parties.** Farhat was surrounded recently at a Hamas victory rally at the women's campus of the Islamic University by young, outspoken, educated women who see no contradiction between religious militancy and modernity.
> [‚Ä¶]
> She said that women, and especially the wives of top Hamas leaders, had long played a central role in Hamas's leadership, though she said that role had not been publicized to **protect** them.
> [‚Ä¶]
> ""It is not only sacrificing sons,"" she said after the rally. ""There are different kinds of sacrifice - by money, by education. Everybody, **according to their ability** [and men's ability, apparently, is to be disposable], should sacrifice.""
> [‚Ä¶]
> ""Every decision that is taken by Hamas is passed to us, not after the decision is made but before,"" she said. But **she also defended the decision of a young Nablus man to become a suicide bomber**.
> [‚Ä¶]
> ""Why not ask the question from another angle?"" she said. ""Why would he blow himself up if he was not **subject to such great pressures**? What leads you to do such a bitter thing? People do this from anger and injustice, to bring back life to their own people by sacrificing their lives.""

A study with the title [Aggression as a function of the interaction of the sex of the aggressor and the sex of the victim (Taylor and Epstein 1967)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-6494.1967.tb01441.x) showed that **both men and women were less likely to administer electric shocks to women than men**. A replication of the experiment with the title [Would You Deliver an Electric Shock in 2015? Obedience in the Experimental Paradigm Developed by Stanley Milgram in the 50 Years Following the Original Studies (Doli≈Ñski et al. 2017)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1948550617693060) also shows this, although their sample size was too small to have statistical significance.  

In a study with the title [Gender Differences in Empathic Sadness towards Persons of the Same- versus Other-sex during Adolescence (Stuijfzand et al. 2016)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5112287/), **boys from the age of 12 showed more empathy for girls than they did for boys, and they continued to show more empathy for females throughout their lives**. Both males and females showed less empathy for males than females. They also state that ""the growing interest in and attraction to the other-sex in adolescence may enhance male adolescents‚Äô empathic responses towards female adolescents (Tello et al. 2012), particularly given that co-operation and feelings of nurturance promote empathy (Batson et al. 2005; Lanzetta and Englis 1989)"" and that ""masculine competitive environment may inhibit empathic responding to male competitors (Tello et al. 2012)"" as ""competition among males may overrule the influence of characteristics such as similarity and familiarity (Ma et al. 2011), which normally promote empathy (Davis 1994; Preston and De Waal 2002)"".

In [Man up and take it: Gender bias in moral typecasting (Reynolds et al. 2020)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0749597820303630?via%3Dihub) it is shown that **people more readily assume female victims and male perpetrators, that people assume that women suffer more pain from their harm, even when women fall in the perpetrator role, see male suffering as more deserved, fair and moral, feel more inclined to punish men and would like to dole out harsher punishments to men, assume more suffering and have more pity for women even in those cases where the real-world discrepancies signal that men have it worse**. Women show a greater bias in almost all of the studies conducted. Also see [Dr. Tania Reynolds' YouTube video about this study](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iR9tixOJSi0) and [this other video in which she talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6EWA_Wg3xI): ""We did this one study where we manipulated whether a politician was talking about issues that afflict women versus issues that afflict men and all the issues were actually only true for men. Men were less likely to suffer from substance abuse, ... we used all of these issues where actually the data supports that men have it worse. And what we found that when a politician talked about men's issues they saw them as less moral and were less willing to vote for them and wanted to donate less to their political campaigns compared to when they were talking about women's issues. Even though it wasn't even true when they were talking about women's issues. Participants even realized that. It suggests where we have this bias where we care more when women are in the victim role than when men are in the victim role.""

**Quoting from [Dr. Tania Reynolds' article on queermajority.com](https://www.queermajority.com/essays-all/man-up-and-take-it-do-we-under-detect-mens-suffering):**
> ""Through the lens of evolution, such a tendency \[to instinctively cast men in the role of perpetrator and women in the role of victim\] can be associated with reproductive roles. Women set the upper limit on reproduction; all other factors being equal, a group of 10 women and 3 men can produce many more children than a group made up of the opposite gender ratio. With this in mind, it‚Äôs not unreasonable to assume that natural selection has favored psychological mechanisms that protect women from harm. If so, our modern minds may possess relics of these asymmetric impulses, attuning our thoughts and emotions to more readily insulate women, relative to men, against peril.""

The author of [Gender Roles and Helping Behavior (Bobbi Hupp-Wilds, 2014)](https://kb.osu.edu/bitstream/handle/1811/60342/Gender_Roles_and_Helping_Behavior.pdf) found:
> \[O\]verall, participants were most likely to help females in dangerous situations, followed by females in emotional situations, males in dangerous situations, and males in emotional situations. As shown in Table 1 males were most likely to help females in dangerous situations, followed by males in dangerous situations, females in emotional situations, and finally males in emotional situations. As shown in Table 1 females were most likely to help females in dangerous situations, followed by females in emotional situations, males in dangerous situations, and finally males in emotional situations. Both male and female participants showed similar helping preferences. Participants were more likely to help in dangerous situations than emotional situations, and **more likely to help females than males**.

In [Gender and Helping Behavior: A Meta-Analytic Review of the Social Psychological Literature (Eagly & Crowley, 1986)](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.458.4047&rep=rep1&type=pdf), the authors show that ""in general men helped more than women and **women received more help than men**"". This difference of women receiving more help than men was due to men helping women being especially prevalent. Sex differences in helping behaviors such as picking up hitchhikers and helping strangers in subways are especially substantial.

The authors of [The Determinants of Punishment: Deterrence, Incapacitation and Vengeance (Glaeser & Sacerdote, 2000)](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w7676/w7676.pdf) found that ""\[a\]mong vehicular homicides, **drivers who kill women get 56 percent longer sentences [than drivers who kill men]**."" In [Sentencing in Homicide Cases and the Role of Vengeance (Glaeser & Sacerdote, 2003)](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/pdf/10.1086/374707), the same authors replicate these findings and find this disparity to be even higher, namely that **drivers who kill women get 59% longer sentences than drivers who kill men**.

In [Cognitive Distortion in Thinking About Gender Issues: Gamma Bias and the Gender Distortion Matrix (Seager & Barry, 2019)](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-04384-1_5), the authors hypothesize about a **""gender distortion matrix""** that suggests an unconscious bias that magnifies gender differences when these differences favor women (alpha bias) and minimizes gender differences when these differences disfavor women (beta bias). Gamma bias, a tendency to magnify some gender differences while minimizing others, combines both alpha and beta bias, which is suggested to be a widespread distortion in modern Western culture whereby **males doing harm is magnified** (""toxic masculinity""), **females doing harm is minimized** (""it's due to trauma""/""she was ill""), **male victimhood is minimized** (male domestic violence victims are overlooked, male suicide victims are overlooked, the fact that being male is the greatest risk factor of dying from COVID-19 after age is ignored, ...), **female victimhood is magnified** (""295 Palestinians, including 42 women and 73 children, were killed by Israeli security forces""), **the privilege of being male is magnified** (men's greater earnings is due to a sexist ""wage gap""), **the privilege of being female is minimized** (it is unremarked that girls get better grades for the same work or that women go to university at a much higher frequency than men), **males doing good things is minimized** (most dirty and dangerous but essential jobs are done by men but this remains unremarked), and **females doing good things is magnified** (a huge number of UN days is reserved to celebrate women for their gender rather than their actions).

The paper [Delta bias in how we celebrate gendertypical traits and behaviours (Seager & Barry, 2020)](https://www.pjp.psychreg.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/seager-barry-168-171.pdf), builds on the theory of gamma bias by introducing a further concept, delta bias. According to the authors:
> Delta bias may be defined as the simultaneous denigration or celebration ‚Äì depending on the gender of the performer ‚Äì of an archetypal masculine gender behaviour or characteristic. This is similar to the ‚Äòcelebration‚Äô aspect of gamma bias, except that delta bias emphasises how celebration tends to occur where the behaviour is gender atypical.

**Quoting Dr. Elizabeth Hobson from her speech against feminism ([transcript](https://static.j4mb.org.uk/2021/11/190524-transcript-of-Elizabeth-Hobsons-talk-at-Cambridge-Uni.pdf), [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IFD4rQIX68))**:
> Before I get stuck into the recorded history of feminism, I need to take a moment to illuminate the biological roots of the movement. Human beings are a gynocentric species ‚Äì this means that we prioritize the needs and well-being of women over men. This is an evolved instinct that came about as a result of **women being the limiting factor in reproduction** ‚Äì i.e. women have a much lower ceiling on how many offspring they can physically produce ‚Äì and in small communities that are subsisting this makes them highly important because they potentially hold the key to whether or not the collective will survive at all. This is why we traditionally send only men to war, this is why we have the ‚Äúwomen and children first‚Äù Birkenhead Drill, this is why people are more likely to put themselves at risk to save a woman in danger than a man ‚Äì and it‚Äôs why we have feminism. **Feminism has taken our gynocentrism and weaponized it.**
> 
> **Men‚Äôs role in this evolutionary sense is to act as a genetic filter** ‚Äì both to mitigate gene replication errors (ie. Preventing less successful combinations multiplying by barring many men from reproducing) and to produce and retain genetic recombinations that enhance the fitness of offspring. To these ends, male fitness is constantly policed to ensure that women‚Äôs standards are met before they gain sexual access ‚Äì which is why far fewer men than women reproduce. Because the pay-off of carrying particularly successful genes is so much greater for men (women will likely have the opportunity to reproduce if their fitness is moderate, men may well not), **evolution gambles with male genes**. This results in very different **bell curves** for men and women in terms of IQ and physical and psychological health, with men being over-represented at either end of the distribution (particularly intelligent/healthy or unintelligent/unhealthy) and women clustering around the middle. Feminists focus on the apex of male achievement to prove that men enjoy greater success than women (whilst ignoring the biological reasons that catapult a minority of men to the stratosphere) and on the acts of the most malevolent minority of men to generalize their patterns of behavior as emblematic of masculinity (whilst ignoring the fact that the very demographics that preoccupy them show that what is emblematic of masculinity is actually variability).
> 
> So, **human beings have always valued women more than men and been more critical of men than women. These were necessary instincts in tribal communities but they have been manipulated to privilege women to the point of dysfunction** ‚Äì and this began with the development of proto-feminism, which arose in the late Middle Ages. Queen consort of France and England, Eleanor of Acquitaine spearheaded a movement within her court to subvert the chivalric code (which had traditionally governed relations between knights and lords and the general public) to regulate the behavior of men towards women. These women initiated a system of romantic feudalism wherein noble men were under irresistible pressure to identify a lady as midons (my lord) and to submit to her will and delicately accept any scorn that his midons saw fit to extend to him. Eleanor established Courts of Love in which she and her noble women would administer ‚Äújustice‚Äù in romantic disputes. Not only may many men in particular recognize this state of gender relations ‚Äì but the modus operandi that Eleanor and co used to achieve their supremacy is entirely familiar: they generalised about all men based on the poor behaviour of a minority, asserting that women needed protection from men‚Äôs violations, and they pushed forward a narrative of women‚Äôs moral superiority, justifying female dictatorship. Within 200 years, Eleanors‚Äô ideas had spread and saturated throughout Europe and throughout the class system. \[‚Ä¶\]

The study called [Judgments About Male Victims of Sexual Assault by Women: A 35-Year Replication Study (PeConga et al., 2022)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/08862605211062990) is a replication of a 1984 study of college students' judgments about male and female victims of sexual assault carried out by male or female assailants. While the male 2019 cohort was **less** likely to judge that the victim initiated or encouraged the incident and derived pleasure from it, the female cohort was **more** likely to attribute victim encouragement and pleasure to the male victim. The pattern was similar w.r.t. how stressful the event was judged to be for the male victim. The authors ""emphasize the need for greater awareness and empirical attention to abuse that runs counter to preconceived notions about sexual victimization"".

In [Impact of Physician and Patient Gender on Pain Management in the Emergency Department‚ÄîA Multicenter Study (Safdar, 2009)](https://academic.oup.com/painmedicine/article/10/2/364/1833196) it was shown that ""\[a\]nalgesic administration rates [in the emergency department] were not significantly different for female and male patients (63% vs 57%, P = 0.08)"". However, ""**females presenting with severe pain (NRS ‚â•8) were more likely to receive analgesics** (74% vs 64%, P = 0.02)"". They also state that this ""was an interesting finding and can be compared with the findings published by Hostetler [33] who studied the administration of IV analgesics (for presumably more severe pain). Of 114,207 adults and 43,725 pediatric patients, females were 1.7 times more likely to receive parenteral analgesics (CI 1.4‚Äì2)"".

The authors of [Gender and aggression I: Perceptions of aggression (Harris & Knight-Bohnhoff, 1996)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01548172) show that people are particularly intolerant of male-to-female aggression:
> Consistent with previous research on gender and aggression, both studies found that the aggressor, target, and respondent all affected perceptions of aggression and likelihood of aggressive behaviors. **Aggression from a male and aggression directed towards a female were particularly likely to be evaluated negatively.**

According to [Police Perceptions of Rape as Function of Victim Gender and Sexuality (Davies, 2009)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1350/pojo.2009.82.1.466), UK police responds more negatively toward hypothetical male rape victims than hypothetical female rape victims.

In [Predicting rape empathy based on victim, perpetrator, and participant gender, and history of sexual aggression. (Osman, 2011)](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2011-06053-005), it is shown that **people were more empathetic towards female than male rape victims**, that they were also **more empathetic towards female rapists than male rapists** (particularly when their victim was male), and that **people were more empathetic towards the perpetrator when the rape victim was male**. Men without victimization experience were relatively non-empathic with a male victim.

The authors of [Evaluations of sexual assault: perceptions of guilt and legal elements for male and female aggressors using various coercive strategies (Russell et al., 2011)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22288097/) show that **college students who were provided with legal instructions of sexual assault and then asked to provide a verdict, degree of guilt, and legal components attribute less guilt to a female-on-male sexual aggressor than a male-on-female sexual aggressor**.

In [Attitudes of Dutch citizens towards male victims of sexual coercion by a female perpetrator (Huitema & Vanwesenbeeck, 2016)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13552600.2016.1159343) it was shown that **male victims of sexual coercion are not taken as seriously as female victims of sexual coercion**, especially among Dutch men. The authors argue that the findings highlight the importance of educational programmes to raise awareness and reduce stereotypical views on male sexual victimisation.

In [Attitudes about victims of workplace sexual harassment based on sex (Cesario, 2020)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666518220300061) the author finds that **male sexual harassment victims are viewed as suffering less than female victims** and that ""\[f\]indings of this study have strong implications for workplace policy and practice"".

In [The Reverse Double Standard in Perceptions of Student-Teacher Sexual Relationships: The Role of Gender, Initiation, and Power (Howell, 2011)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00224540903510837) it was found that ""**participants judged situations [of sexual relations between students and teachers] involving male teachers more harshly than they judged situations involving female teachers**, but only when the sexual contact was teacher-initiated. Participants also believed that male students received more social benefits from the sexual contact than did female students"".

In [National Baseline Study on Violence against Children (Philippines EXECUTIVE SUMMARY, 2016)](https://www.unicef.org/philippines/media/491/file/National%20Baseline%20Study%20on%20Violence%20Against%20Children%20in%20the%20Philippines:%20Results%20(executive%20summary).pdf) it is shown that **boys are at least as or more vulnerable than girls to all forms of violence**. Particularly, when it comes to _severe physical_ violence, boys are almost twice as likely to experience it (4.0% for boys vs 2.2% for girls). Perhaps most surprisingly, males were found to experience sexual violence more frequently than females overall (24.7% for boys vs 18.2% for females). It is also noteworthy that the lifetime-prevalence seems to underestimate the greater abuse suffered by boys, and it is thus preferable to look at the 12-month prevalence where available. You may find [Recall Bias can be a Threat to Retrospective and Prospective Research Designs (Hassan, 2005)](https://print.ispub.com/api/0/ispub-article/13060) and [Has ‚Äòlifetime prevalence‚Äô reached the end of its life? An examination of the concept (Streiner et al., 2009)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/mid/NIHMS767462/) useful towards this end.

See this YouTube video with the title [Karen Straughan in The Red Pill on Boko Haram](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BD3PqQfwgaY) which illustrates our lack of empathy on a cultural level. Boko Haram kidnapped over 10,000 boys and made them into child soldiers compared to the 276 girls they kidnapped which created a public uproar with slogans like ""Bring Back our Girls"". Not just that but they were even entering schools and outright killing the male students and keeping the female students alive. Yet, there was no news coverage for the same issue affecting boys. When everything is set up to make it look like women have it worse then obviously many people are going to believe that.

**Quoting William Collins from his book [The Empathy Gap: Male Disadvantages and the Mechanisms of Their Neglect](https://www.amazon.com/Empathy-Gap-Disadvantages-Mechanisms-Neglect/dp/0957168888)**:
> The empirical evidence for an empathy gap against males, associated with a widespread gynocentric orientation, is overwhelmingly strong. It is remarkable that this remains imperceptible to the general public, and to feminists in particular. The reason is gynocentrism itself, which promotes its own invisibility. Key evolved traits are generally motivated in the individual by emotions. One does not consciously eat in order to fulfil the evolutionary function of remaining a viable organism until genetic transmittal has been accomplished. One eats because one is hungry. But, in truth, the latter is the trick that evolution plays upon one in order to accomplish the former objective. Hunger, and the pleasure of eating, are proximate causes of a behaviour whose distal origin is successful genetic promulgation. In the same way, there is a complex of emotions which promotes the pair bond. 
> 
> Evolved matricentrism is enacted by those same emotions which drive the pair bond. This includes, for example, the key element of the ceding of moral authority to mothers, and by extension to women in general. One of the associated correlates of this moral authority is men's discomfort at female disapproval. The veil which has obscured this matricentrism is the traditional patriarchy which the feminists are so intent on smashing. The societal respect which patriarchy embodied hid, and hence made tolerable to men, the underlying matricentric subservience. As matricentrism has intensified into feminist gynocentrism, and the veil of respect for men has been withdrawn, another mechanism of obscuration has become necessary. This is the doctrine of female oppression and poisonous masculinity. For most people now, this new perspective on the sexes serves very effectively to hide gynocentrism. But it is a step too far. One cannot sweeten the pill by making it more bitter still. Some people are now rejecting a pill so bitter that it requires service to those who will continue to despise you. Matricentrism was never truly invisible to the  inquiring mind, more of an invisibility of convenience. And gynocentrism can be, and is being, perceived and resisted by many people, of both sexes. For women, resisting gynocentric tendencies may be equated with the responsible use of their power, motivated by the recognition of feminism's corrosive effects. \[‚Ä¶\]",On the Gender Empathy Gap and its correlates: a comprehensive collection of resources (Part I),2.0,2.0

So we recently had an incident with a DoorDash driver and I wanted to get y‚Äôall‚Äôs opinion on it. I work in a restaurant that offers delivery thru Uber eats DoorDash and Grubhub.  The way it works is the third party driver comes up to the take out door and we hand them the food.  If it‚Äôs not ready we tell them that and when the food is ready we give it to them.  Never really had a problem.  For some context.  Most of my coworkers are not a fan of the third party delivery drivers for two reasons.  A lot of them are just plain rude to us when we have no control over when the food is coming.  Also because we aren‚Äôt getting tipped on those orders, so if we have an hour of third party deliveries we make below minimum wage which sucks. I have been both a doordasher and worked in restaurants so at a bare minimum I am courteous.  Sometimes I‚Äôll offer drinks if the time is getting long to try to be nice.   I always give out quote times.  And if DoorDash sent them way before the order is ready I‚Äôll let them know so they can cancel it because time is money and I wouldn‚Äôt want to hang around for 20 minutes for a 4 dollar tip.  

With all that context.  This is what happened a couple of days ago.  Our kitchen was running VERY behind.  Like 40 minutes behind on checks.  Our salad guys are all new and so it could take up to 20 minutes for a salad.  (Not per salad but because they get backed up) So I get a phone call from a customer.  She says she is a regular and that this is the first time she has ordered food thru DoorDash because she wasn‚Äôt feeling well.  She said it wasn‚Äôt right to offer DoorDash if we were going to not care about providing the service.  I apologized did some explaining on how our system works and said I would go look for her food.  I ask my coworkers about the order and what the quote time is on it. They are like what do you mean he (the dasher) already has the food.  I look out the door and the dasher gives me a sarcastic wave.  At this point I‚Äôm just confused so I go out and I‚Äôm speaking to the dasher like what‚Äôs going on?  He is mad the food took so long.  I told him that he has the food now and that it‚Äôs just getting colder now and he needs to go deliver the food.  He now is insisting on speaking to a manager so my coworker continues to argue with him while I grab the GM.   The GM comes over and the doordasher want my GM to come down the stairs (like three steps) and ‚Äúhave a conversation with him‚Äù my GM says I am listening but I have an entire restaurant to run in the middle of dinner service.  The doordasher then complains he wants us (me and the other employee to leave) so my GM tells us to take off.  We do.    I don‚Äôt know what my manager said.  But the guy gets in his car and doesn‚Äôt leave.   All this time the customer has been on hold so I pick up the phone and apologize.  I told her that the doordasher has had the food for like 15 minutes now.   He is being belligerent and refusing to take the order. I assure her that no one in the restaurant has any intention of holding her food hostage.  She is upset reasonably so.  I offer to give her to the manager.  She declined so I let her go.  The doordasher is sitting in his car with the food in the fire lane furiously texting what looks like the customer and I can‚Äôt imagine he is saying favorable things about the staff or the restaurant.  Which sucks because he isn‚Äôt an employee or a customer. 

At any rate.  I just was upset about that incident.  I think the doordasher was being a total bitch.  We had given him the food.  And instead of delivering it he decided he wanted to get into it with the employees and manager of the restaurant for some purpose of his own which I couldn‚Äôt possibly begin to fathom.  Let me know what y‚Äôall think.

eg4ce6,"Hi everyone, I didn't think I would go back to writing a post about this community because of the general unpopularity of my 2 first my posts (of which I deleted the content hoping that the whole post would be deleted with attached comments, only to later discover that on this site only administrators have such power).

I was initially determined to give up, go on and focus on my other interests in this website, however, in recent days, reflecting on it with a cold and clear mind, I realized that I was wrong to write my opinion on the characters of Eva/EVA-Beatrice and Sayo/Beatrice (who clearly they are the favorites of most of you) with arrogance.

So I thought I owed all you an apology and to explain to you more calmly why, for me, the ending of Umineko is not as perfect as it seems and why some characters (including those 2-4 that I mentioned), who made the worst, more monstrous things that a human being can accomplish, were all too forgiven with the happy ending in the afterlife while others more innocent, although obviously they're not completly saint, like Rosa, had to go through so much splatterly bloody and hellishly painful shits before being forgiven.

Not to mention the fact that I consider the scarce-total lack not only physical but also of interest by R07 as be very serious for characters such as Sayo's mother (which I would have preferred a thousand times more as the protagonist of the VN instead of her incestuous fruit of child rape with  that shitty bastard of her disgusting father) and grandmother, Kyrie's family, the Black Witch of Rosa (which is clearly sure that she exist and she's not EVA-Bitchrice as Ange/R07 tries to make us believe in Alliance) or the deceased WIFE of Kinzo (a character in my opinion certainly much more vital than someone like Asumu).

Let's start with the origin of all evil, Kinzo Ushiromiya.

I hope that, at least with him, all you will agree with me if I say that such a victim, lousy and miserable person as he absolutely did not deserve to die in peace as he actually died (one of the few moments in the series in which I understand Sayo and I agree with him/her) and that although he almost always gets what he deserves, it is never enough if you compare his painful but fast deaths with the endless and horrible tortures to which Natsuhi and Rosa (both victims of emotional and mental abuse by all their relatives and therefore with a psychologically valid reason for acting in the way they act) are subjected at the hands of Sayo/Beatrice.

We then move on to his little friend and servant Genji, who is not happy to be stained with concealment of corpses and crimes related to incest and child rape, thinks well that the best way to protect a child from his father pedophile and his daughter-in-law last, is to raise him as one of the future servants of the family of this pedophile father and his daughter-in-law, what a genius (and I, who in his place, would have adopted and raised him far from the island as my son or I would have given him to Kumasawa who would have done the same)!

We continue with Krauss, the one who to compensate for his lack of self-esteem and confidence in his abilities, comes to emulate the sexist ideology and misogyny of the abusive father and begins to mistreat his siblings to the point of hitting his youngest baby sister so loudly to make her spit blood (you all are very good to fiercely criticize Rosa, who gets pull Maria's hair and violently push her to the ground when she loses control but we feel lucky that she's not Krauss).

This only in his young years, in his middle age as he has made bad investments, he thinks well not only of taking away the shares of all his siblings (of which one is a single mother so stressed and tired to the point of having developed some symptoms of bipolar disorder and with a very problematic 9-year-old autistic daughter) but even to hide the death of the father together with his wife, in order to maintain their inheritance advantage.

Having said that what punishment does he suffer in Sayo's hands?

Just a few quick deaths.

Let's go to Eva, now we all already know more or less what I think about the fact that I finds so OVERVALUED that she developed a witch from her suffering if you compare her with Rosa (I speak before the Rokkenjima accident, from which I can give credit that Eva suffered more with the lost of her family and the partially earned hatred Ange and the society feel towards her), which has objectively gone worse, so I limit myself to judging her only as Eva and not EVA-Shitriche.

Eva is an adult woman who, despite being middle-aged, basically acts like the mean girl of the school that you find in any classic western teen drama/comedy (not surprisingly, her witch has the appearance of a stupid, spoiled and capricious brat who acts as if constantly thinks that everything in the world and meta-world is due to her).

She is a middle-age woman who affirms (without any valid demonstration) several times that since she was a little girl, without anyone specifically imposing it on her, she has always committed herself to everything in order to prove herself as the perfect daughter among Kinzo's 4 children as well as the only one worthy of inheriting gold and his position as head of the family.

However, when she was told that as a woman she should rather think about pleasing her future husband, Eva, instead of literally screwing up both her father and brother and maybe trying to have academic and professional success on her own, she behaved like all rich and spoiled children like her they behave when they don't get what they want (because regardless of the fact that I also recognize and justify her to being pissed for a similar injustice, the way she then decides to behave is even more questionable of how Krauss behaves towards her), that is, she continued to remain fixed for DECADES on the sole and only objective of snatching the position of heir to Krauss and goes so far to the point of getting married and systematically having a son before her big brother and raising this child under a very strict regime maternal aimed at instructing him to be the perfect heir of his grandfather (in a comment concerning my first post on how I found the existence of EVA-Beatrice meaningless someone wrote to me that witches are not born from the desire for revenge but from the deep desire of their human persons to make their own choices and make their own decisions, mentioning that Eva, like Sayo, never had a choice in anything in her life. I'm mentioning it to you in brackets just to show that person he/she's wrong).

Also, she literally mistreats and abuses Natsuhi (just because she is her brother's wife) and Rosa's (just because she isn't as unhealthy as obsessed with the family business organization as she is and only for this she is the most dumb sibling for Eva), costantly offending them, belittling them and attacking them (even when they do absolutely nothing to provoke her, see when Eva makes unpleasant comments to Rosa on the age of Maria in EP 2 or when she scolds e made of fun of her sister in EP3 when this latter begins to tell of her very serious childhood trauma) continuously both as women and as mothers (and to think that there are those who consider her a feminist as I had read it in a forum once).

Eva's biggest flaw is that, precisely because she is emotionally and mentally a narcissistic child, in addition to considering herself better than all her brothers and sister, she thinks that only her problems and needs are worthy of attention; for example:

1. She knows very well that Natsuhi, unlike her, is the one who has had no choice in anything in her life since her parents were forced to sell her to Kinzo as Krauss' bride to pay off a debt as she was forced to bear passively the humiliations and reproaches on the part of Kinzo and Krauss especially regarding her apparent inability to have a child.
2. She also knows that her younger sister is much more in need than her of their father's gold (the financial problems of Hideyoshi and Eva are the least serious of all parents) since, unlike Eva, she is alone, she does not live a life particularly wealthy, she has a company that unlike that of her brother-in-law is on the verge of bankruptcy and must also pay with a large sum of money to fully pay off the debts in which Maria's father left her.

Eva, and by extension EVA-B, knows all of these and still has the courage to play the victim when she complains about her problems and reproaches Rosa with hatred in EP 3 by telling her that, unlike her, she has never worked hard at nothing, that she is worthless and don't deserves nothing etc. as well as making that utterly horrible line to Natsuhi that she's just a human incubator for the family's heir in EP1.

Nothing positive that is then subsequently shown in the last few episodes on her account redeems her completely in my eyes, especially when I take into account the fact that as well as she did with Rosa when this latter was a child and as then Rosa did with Maria, she abused Ange (again, all to crucify Rosa after EP4 and to sanctify Eva after EP7, however, few who take into account the fact that Eva is equal to Rosa if not worse, specially if we add her ability to kill an other human being).

Taking away her punishment for having lived a miserable life with Ange for 12 years after surviving in some games, probably after her sister and father she is the one who dies as painfully as possible, however considering that in at least 3 we see her surviving and in one of them her witch is the one who is going to inflict the worst bloody tortures on the whole family in revenge, forgive me if I burn with anger and contempt for the sanctification and happy ending that both the two Eve have received.

We almost conclude with that filthy of Rudolf and that loathsome killer and sociopathic whore of his wife Kyrie.

Where to start with Rudolf?

Did the fact that all the child abuse techniques which Rosa subjects her daughter learned them directly from her brother?

From the fact that he plays with women, including his wife and his main lover, seeing them more as mere sexual objects with which to let off steam than as people?

From the fact that he literally exchanged his children 2 that he had with 2 different women on the same day of their birth (randomness take me away x'D)?

From the fact that as in romantic life, even in his working life, he and Kyrie enjoy cheating and doing illegal business which in the long run have led some of their victims to commit suicide in despair and, nevertheless, they don't seem to feel remorse?

The fact that even his own children Battler and Ange consider him a lousy person?

Kyrie maybe it is also useless to mention her, someone like her would deserve to be closed in some cell and left to rot for the rest of her days considering that she can even kill Maria, who is only 3 years older than her daughter, immediately after having killed her mother in cold blood and without feeling the slightest remorse.

In Battler and Beatrice's games, they too, like Eva, are almost seems like a living Karma Houdini when are compared to Rosa that, only because she is a violent mother who, presumably (yes because Maria's diary is not a 100% reliable source), she also makes herself the weekly holidays with her lovers at the spa without the daughter being on her way, deserves the worst possible and unimaginable tortures and deaths while the 3 of them, who have proven themselves capable of exterminating an entire family out of pure greed, are so beautiful and good to deserve the grace of quick death and to survive in some of the fragments.

Last but not least, Sayo alias the third Beatrice, a guilty judge who manipulated a little girl's resentment and pain towards her mother and the rest of her family for his/her comforts, who blackmailed and threatened with death anyone around him/her and who only for a stupid promise made by a child, whom he/she last saw 6 years ago, decides, to take revenge for the return of the aforementioned boy now, to put into practice his/her very crazy murder-suicide plan which it involves not only all the people he/she hates but also those he/she loves and who love him/her.",The reason why I condemn certain characters of Umineko that many love.,2.0,2.0

The prime example is, *of course*, the in(famous) ‚ÄúPriest‚Äù, but I think I liked the second book in the series, ‚ÄúSinner‚Äù, even more. 


A good example is also ‚ÄúDead Man Walking‚Äù and ‚ÄúDangerous Temptation‚Äù by Giana Darling (they‚Äôre just filthy and kinky to the core like MCs having sex >!over a dying man!< lol) 


Both books from ‚ÄúSouls‚Äù series by Harley Laroux are a great example of that (with things like >!knife and blood play/sex in the cemetery/sex while being pierced/anal sex/sex over a dead body!< etc etc) 


‚ÄúSing me to Sleep‚Äù is also a good example (>!CNC with a freaky demon MMC and his appendages like the inhumanely long tongue!<)

I‚Äôm a female player who‚Äôs currently LEM and trying to improve and play competitively. 

But it‚Äôs really frustrating to play and give callouts only to be met with sexual comments, belittling and sexist ‚Äòjokes‚Äô. 

It‚Äôs just super unnecessary and it really takes the focus and the fun out of the game.

Worst cough I had in my life, wasn't painful or uncomfortable it was just all the time. Sometimes talking or coughing brought on a coughing fit, was quite funny at times.

But ever since then despite the pandemic getting much worse, much more cases and still taking little to no precautions being around folks who are take little precautions or themselves had covid.

I just think it's strange how I haven't gotten it again. Got 2 vaccines not the booster for travel reasons and it all felt a bit in vain honestly since I never got the virus again.

Either it's mad coincidence, the vaccine is more effective than I realise or is it possible for people to be entirely immune from covid?

Obviously, the woke left will launch baseless claims of white supremacy, but they'll do that with anyone so it's not even a point worth considering. However I've seen some in the anti-regressive sphere who seem to characterize Tucker Carlson's show as this partisan fox news echo chamber, which I don't think is fair at all.

Here is IDW member Joe Rogan with an [excellent summary on Tucker Carlson](https://www.reddit.com/r/JoeRogan/comments/rwvv5l/joe_rogan_praising_tucker_carlson/).

What I like about the IDW and I think is one of it's strengths is that we as the politically homeless don't have to play the rival treehouse game of what's 'our' news station vs 'their' news station we just want to hear rational thought. Who cares if Tucker Carlson is on Fox News? If he's having a productive discussion with an outstanding individual like Andrew Yang, then why shouldn't we listen?

I cannot fathom why everyone is so excited and loves this show so much. Like, reviews saying its *‚ÄùThe best show ever‚Äù* *‚ÄùI think this is the greatest show I‚Äôll ever see‚Äù*, they go ‚Äòbut look at all the dead wife sequences‚Äô. And, Gervais being up there in comedy like, ***Merchant‚Ä¶ Gervais‚Ä¶*** No!

What is it he‚Äôs writing about, exactly? A little sad fella who can‚Äôt get over his dead wife‚Ä¶ I mean, I‚Äôve been through loss, just sign off for a mail-order wife. Its like Derek taken seriously‚Ä¶ But I know who‚Äôs watching it, it‚Äôs those people who obviously think they can have a go, thinking ‚Äòwell I‚Äôll write a tv show then!‚Äô *Gary kills a tramp‚Ä¶* and their thirteen year old son who who‚Äôs never shown an interest in anything except glue now writes *Cunt!* on his exercise book, so now they‚Äôre loving it.

But in the end, and it‚Äôs taken them like 9 hours, to get absolutely nowhere, character development-wise‚Ä¶ In the end, the dead junkie homeless fella comes back right‚Ä¶ and they all hug, and there‚Äôs the little stupid one Rixy‚Ä¶ Roxy‚Ä¶ Roxa‚Ä¶ you know. 

But anyway, he‚Äôs hugging all the main characters, I don‚Äôt know how many of them there are, and it is the most interminable thing I‚Äôve ever seen. Like he hugs one and they look into each other‚Äôs eyes and he goes to the next one, but then thankfully they all just do one big group hug, like an American football team. But then, right, the homeless guy‚Äôs arms sort of reach all the way around the group hug, and like, he‚Äôs got really long arms and that. And they think that‚Äôs weird, and then they look down and it only turns out he‚Äôs a little monkey fella. Little chimp homeless fella. Weird, that. Anyway, its dragging on and on and on‚Ä¶

But anyway, apparently on Youtube there‚Äôs an extra 20-25 minutes of extra footage of scenes he‚Äôs cut out! Who‚Äôs watching this tripe!? Who cares!?

We went for shopping for both of us and bought couple of sexy dresses and bikini's for the trip.  
At last that day came. It was our vacation after long time. So she was also very excited.  
When we reached the resort, we were very pleased to see the resort. It was a very beautifully maintained beach resort. We got a room in first floor, with the view to the wave pool and the beach. We had planned 1 week stay. We roamed around the resort to see amenities like tennis courts, beach volleyball etc.  
First 2 days my wife dressed normally in shorts and t-shirts, and sometimes a properly covered swimwear in pool. But seeing other ladies dress in sexy dress and bikini she got the confidence to dress sexier. In next couples of days she started wearing sexy dress in drinking area and bikini in pools.  
It was the last day of our trip, i told my wife to get ready early so we can roam around and have some fun. she was wearing some makeup, she asked me to go near the beach and wait there, she will get ready and come. It was around 20 minutes later when i am in beach waiting for my wife and enjoying beach view I see my in g-string white bikini with black coverup walking towards me smiling. Her hair was left open, she also had put sexy makeup on face with lipstick and body lotion on her body. She looked like a sexy model from Baywatch. I smiled and asked how come she dressed so sexy today, she told me 'since it was our last day she thought why not dress in a sexy manner and enjoy'.  
She removed her cover up and asked me to keep it in my bag. After that we decided to relax in the beach. After few minutes we decided to roam around the beach and go near other side of the beach. While we were walking to other side of the beach I noticed guys oogling at my wife. Her body was looking very sexy dress with sand over her bikini body. I told my wife look 'guys are staring at you'. She felt shy but i think enjoyed the attention.  
In few minutes we saw a volleyball court in beach and saw bunch of guys playing volleyball. People were watching them play so we decided to stay and watch. 2 of the guys who were playing volleyball introduced themselves to us and we started chatting. They seemed like decent guys, they were well built and polite. After chatting for 20 minutes, they asked us if wanted to join them while. Though a bit hesistant my wife and i thought why not, we started playing volleyball with them. It was a team of 4 each with me and my wife in opposite sides. My wife seemed involved in the game having fun and totally engaged. She was good at volleyball. I noticed some of the guys watching would look at my wife clevage while she was serving or hitting. Some times when she bent to pick up ball they used to stare at her ass. I think largely abya was unaware of this as she was having fun. I also had fun thinking it was harmless staring.  
After few minutes some guys told its around 12 o clock, wave pool would start. Lets go to pool and enjoy. abya was bored with volleyball , so was i. We all went to wavepool together. It was total 9 guys excluding me. By now i and abya had become comfortable with these guys. All the guys jumped into the wave pool, i kept my bag in corner and then me and mine entered the wave pool through corner. We were in the area were waves was very slow. These guys were calling us near medium tide wave are which was the center of the pool, where they were standing and playing. We decided to go there.  
When we went near center of pool with medium tide, i noticed my wife's bikini. Since she had been in water first time with this white bikini, her white bikini was touching her body. I felt it might have become a bit smaller in water. abya g-string panty was completly tightly touching her ass . her bra was tightly touching her boobs, showing her nipples shape. She was looking super hot. when we went near these guys, i noticed now 2 guys staring intently at ass. one of them had an buldge, i could see that in his shorts.  
Still when abya or me were talking to them, they behaved well. we all decided we will make a circle and stand, with abya in the center. My wife was also not particularly worried since i was right there. I started noticing something after few minutes. My wife's bikini was becoming a little bit more transparent and a bit more thin. The difference was minute but it was noticebale to me. I was worrying if wave in the water will slowly make her bikini transparent and thin. It was still fine nothing to worry, i was about to pull her to the side and tell her this when i heard someone calling my name with room no.  
It was resort staff, i was yet to pay some due and they asked please can you clear it now since during our evening checkout nobody will be there. I told fine I will come near reception in 2minutes. I thought this was time when i tell everyone me and my wife are going back. During this time my wife was playing with the guys in water playfully, pushing them and they were all being playful with each other. She had become comfortable. One guy suggested to go near the wave pool entrance (were water force is highest) to the group. my wife and other guys agreed. I said no need , i have to pay due amount to resort. me and abya will be going back to room. abya told me ‚Äúplease , once i want near start of pool were wave force it highest. It will only be for 5 minutes‚Äù. One of the volleyball guys told me ‚Äòcommon man its 5 minutes let her go near the front and enjoy, anyways wave pool ends in 30 minutes‚Äô.  
I Decided to go by myself to counter to pay due, and let my wife enjoy for few more minutes. I was worried a bit about her bikini becoming transparent then i though maybe few minutes wont make much difference and its anyways our last day of vacation.  
As i collected my bag and was going towards the room to collect cash for payment. I noticed my wife with 9 guys going towards front of the pool where wave was maximum. There was almost no other girl there near front of pool, i guess due to high water \[force.\](http://force.it/) It was filled with around 20 guys, I wondered if the guys in the group also realized if my wife‚Äôs bikini is becoming transparent and suggested it purposely. I was thinking these thoughts as i climbed the stairs and entered my room. I took the cash and just came to balcony. Our balcony has view towards front of wave pool, abya knew but think other guys did not.  
I just wanted to casually wave at everyone from balcony but i was shocked to see how abya looked. It had been only few minutes since abya had entered in high force area of the pool. Her bikini was more thinner and transparent. water force was making her bikini thinner faster. Most of her ass was visible now, with bikini just covering her ass crack line. Plus she was slipping in water due to high force of water and falling. I felt these guys were using this as an excuse to feel her up.  
2 guys in particular mathew and dan were the worst. The had talked to abya the most and were standing the closest to her( dan in front and mathew was behind her). dan would fall on usha pretending to slip on her from front towards her boobs, while mathew tried to balance by holding her from behind (touching her hips, thighs and sometimes ass). I wanted to immediately call abya up to the room, but something was stopping me. I guess i was a bit curious and turned on at same time and wanted to know what happened. I saw some other guys were now also complimenting abya on her looks. All 9 guys stopped talking much to each other and were giving attention to abya. abya seem to be enjoying the attention but she didnt realise i think what was happening. she was just thinking it was playfull attention.  
As time passed abya‚Äôs bikini become bolder (her bra had become transparent) both front up and down. this started attracting more attention, now some guys in front of the pool were staring at abya. I think this is when abya realised something is wrong. abya suddenly realised her bikini had become transparent and very thin. Random guys were now openly commenting. I heard comments like ‚Äúman, what a round and sexy ass, i would love to fuck that‚Äô. Some other guy commented on her boobs. 1 guy was trying to take pic of her body with his. iphone. She become very uncomfortable and looked around to see were i was. She made signs to other volleyball guys she wants to leave. I saw dan and mathew convincing her to wait 10 minutes since wave pool in ending and so she can go after that. She reluctantly agreed.  
I was secretly looking from first floor room balcony eager to see what will happens next, now i was also turned on seeing so many guys were looking at my wife like a sex object. There was now only 5 minutes left to the wavepool to end, i noticed groping of my wife by dan, mathew and 7 other volleyball guys increased. Before they had done subtly, now they seemed in hurry. abya was realising now they were feeling her up , she was indifferent looking at the clock i guess thinking its only 5 minutes and waited for it to end. These guys were trying to now touch her thighs, boobs , waist, ass. It was getting bolder very second .Comments by random guys in the pool also increased , they started coming closer to abya and started making more dirty comments.  
One random brown guy commented looking at my wife and removing down his boxer ‚Äò i would like put this inside her ass‚Äô. Another random other guy removed his boxers and told ‚Äò i want squeeze your boobs and flap my dick in it. By now 4 random guys with cock‚Äôs erect had started jerking off looking at my wife. (these were random guys in pool not the one we played volleyball with)  
I noticed my wife‚Äôs face, she looked around realizing 4 random guys were jerking off to her and 9 guys were feeling her up. But this time i think her face was different, i saw she was heavily breathing, with face flushed , I was thinking was getting turned on by this. Dan now become bolder and started rubbing her pussy while the guys in the pool were jerking off to her. I could see this made my wife super turned on. She was trembling  
Seeing my wife‚Äôs reaction to random guys jerking off to her gave confidence to these volleyball guys to remove their shorts. They all opened their shorts zipper once and started showing their cock, more than 10 guys showing their cock to my wife made my dick go very hard. This was the hardest my dick had ever been. Mathew who was standing behind my wife pulled her thin panty line from behind to side which was anyways for namesake covering her ass and inserted his dick inside her asshole, dan who was standing in front of removed his figure and inserted his dick in her pussy. My wife was getting double penetrated in the pool. She was getting fucked in ass and pussy and she was loving it. I also started rubbing my cock hard looking at this.  
By now abya closed her eyes a bit and leaned back on mathew(who was still fucking from behind), she started moaning first slowly and later moaning pace increased. By now pretense of playing in water was completely out, these 15 guys (9 volleyball + 6 guys from pool) wanted to fuck my wife. They surrounded her so others cant find out what was happening. there was only 2 minutes left now though. Every few seconds 2 guys tried to double penetrate her and take turns, while rest of the guys talked dirty and groped.  
By now my wife had become active participant from passive recipient. She was asking them to comment on her body.  
I heard her saying things like ‚ÄòTell me guys, do i look hot‚Äô?‚Äô. ‚ÄòDoes my ass turn on your cock‚Äô, ‚ÄòHow is my boobs‚Äô . ‚ÄòDo you love my pussy‚Äô while getting double penetrated in ass and pussy. She had also started rubbing cocks with her hand helping guys to cum. Looking at her behave like that , made me started cumming. I never expected my wife to become sexy slut.  
I saw only few seconds were left for wave pool to end , i got to thinking that my wife would come to room and ask did you pay the bill, so i hurried to counter to pay the bill and came back. I saw from far my wife wearing bikini with towel outside the pool (i guess some guy would have given her his towel), she was still talking to one of the volleyball guys and having a slice of pizza outside the pool. I went into room fast and pretended to be asleep.  
When she came to room after 5 minutes, she told what have i been doing?. I told her i was tired and hence after paying bill decided to take her some rest. She told me she is tired too and feel on the bed with me and gave me a hug.

rxft82,"Hello! i am adopting my first dog, a 7 years old pomeranian (woo!) from my relative. it is my first doggo but ive watched several videos :D I was buying some stuff for the dogs and i asked my relative if the harness i was planning to buy is suitable for my dog since she has more experience. She then replied saying that the dog isnt used to walking in a harness and it would just run around free on her pretty big garden (idk why but shes pretty old so maybe that) and that if i walk with it the dog could get ticks from other animals or maybe attack/be attacked by other animals (there are some strays but im chill some of the cats lol theyre cute) so she told me not to walk the dog but like still expose her to sunlights n stuff.

i do have an outdoor area for the dog to play in and maybe i could make up the lack of exercise by playing with it more but i think walking it would be better but i also dont want to harm it and i barely have any expirience so im not really sure if i should do as she said or no lol. any advices are welcome. thanks!

rt6ubx,"Many people have been asking me about what happened and how things are going. If you want to read about some of my past, the posts should be still up on my account. As the post says, my Mistress is aware of this Reddit account and I will follow Her orders.

  
During one of the times that I wanted to update everyone, I started typing up my story. I left my computer open and Mistress saw my account. For a while She didn't say anything until we were in a session together that night. My hands were cuffed and I was licking Mistress's foot while Her other foot was rubbing my cunt. She told me about how She saw my account. I freaked out. I apologized. I begged Her not to punish me.

  
Instead of punishing me She peeled off Her panties and showed how wet She was. She had clearly been thinking about it a lot. Mistress told me how much of a turn on it was that I was telling the internet about how She owned me. The post I made about the time I first fucked my Mistress especially turned Her on. She said She felt like a slut in front of the world and kept thinking about all the stories I already posted about us. Her boyfriend was away at the time and She asked me to fuck Her again. I left the room to grab the strap-on and when I came back what I saw shocked me. Mistress had a ring gag in Her mouth, nipple clamps on Her tits and clit and a collar She would use on me that said ""SLUT"".

  
Just like that night, I fucked my Mistress as She commanded. I could tell She was incredibly wet and turned on by finding my account. She bent over the nightstand and watched Herself in the full body mirror as She was fucked by me. She moaned louder and louder as the chains swung and the gag made her drool down Her chin. I kept going but I was dripping from watching Mistress and seeing how slutty we both looked. Mistress grunted a few times and pointed to the paddle, so I stopped and began to spank Her. It was then that I saw Her inner thighs were completely wet too. She then begged through the gag for me to fuck Her again as She began to suck a dildo on the night stand through the ring gag and moaned loudly and squealed with every thrust in Her. I rarely saw Mistress like this but clearly She was very turned on.

  
We kept going until She stopped sucking and and took the gag out, I stopped as well thinking she had enough and was even more shocked when She spun around and began to kiss and suck the strap-on. Her kisses were sloppy and She was panting like a dog. I stood there not really knowing what to do. She talked about how much it turned Her on that She was portrayed as a slut in the last story. We then moved to the bed and kissed as She rode the strap-on to an orgasm.  
The next morning I decided to post two pictures and later that day I ended up cumming in my office. She of course saw the posts and I came back from work to Mistress with Her legs spread and rubbing herself begging me to fuck Her again.

  
It seems that being exposed gets Her uncontrollably horny and wet. About a month ago, I posted a more revealing picture of Her at Her request. We've agreed that even if She gets like this that She is still my Mistress, but She is also a submissive slut. Throughout my entire writing of this, She's been licking my pussy on Her knees with a remote vibrator and a butt plug inside of Her. She's been moaning and responding to me addressing Her as a ""slave's slut"", a ""needy whore"", and more. To prove She has who She is in the pictures posted, She has even agreed to provide proof from the last picture I just posted. She desperately wants to see the comments you all have for Her and what you have to call Her.

I understand this mindset as I have a lot to bring to a relationship and my ideal women, a sweet and submissive housewife with no career, is abundant and brings functionally nothing but enjoyment to a relationship which I can find elsewhere or can just continue to have in my casual dating life. What I fight with is I have always dreamed of having a dedicated long term relationship and settling down but fight with these ideas in my own head.

I liked the variety of restaurants, the art in all its forms and the rich history. I worked for companies with great cultures, putting their employees first. I enjoyed the never ending parties that are less about hooking up and more about music. I have learned so much.
Overall, it has been an amazing experience.

But I left because of the people. As tolerant as they might be, 9 out of 10 times people are extremely rude. 
Whether it‚Äôs a hospital, a bar, a reception, a supermarket, ‚Ä¶ people are miserable, unhelpful and angry.
Why do people accept this? And why are Germans unfriendly in general?
The behaviour is contagious, and everyone starts to shout at each other for not being in the right place or doing the right thing. In fact, I have found myself shouting at people much more than before.

Before Monday opens I just want to do an After Action report in the wake of the Jan 7th Pearl Harbour [attack we just sustained](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=newssearch&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwid4_aPk6f1AhU6kHIEHYaxCt8QxfQBKAB6BAgUEAI&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnbc.com%2F2022%2F01%2F07%2Fgamestop-shares-surge-16percent-after-news-it-plans-to-launch-an-nft-marketplace.html&usg=AOvVaw0vj2heq_A_wbLlqM3kJCvg). Some peeps tagged me asking to do a follow-up of my last sus-themed DD since Friday‚Äôs IV pump-n-dump + basket cover played out much as we expected.

While +7.32% is by no means a Bad Day, it wasn‚Äôt the start of MOASS we were teased with when the AH price action started ripping over 30%. .\\/.

In hindsight it is now clear that the WSJ was a FUD bomb, targeted to steal RC‚Äôs Thunder of an impending NFT marketplace launch. The barrage of ham-fisted MSM articles the day after [deriding the NFT Marketplace](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=newssearch&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjCjYibk6f1AhWFoHIEHUC-COAQxfQBKAB6BAgOEAI&url=https%3A%2F%2Fca.finance.yahoo.com%2Fvideo%2Fgamestops-planned-nft-marketplace-dead-170904327.html&usg=AOvVaw2xvr7OkwiAaFdYa2FfNOEr) was more confirmation this was a straight-up hit job.

But at what cost?

&#x200B;

[So, was it worth it?](https://preview.redd.it/vgg8jysy9va81.jpg?width=606&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0683e4ed657085c4a9aead3e4f71f1248128c6f5)

I‚Äôm going to take the unpopular opinion side of this here and say that RC was wide open for this torpedo attack. All the Loopring tweets, the job postings, the SMRT comments, dropping hints for weeks on end was like letting a wet dog loose in the house. They could have put Loop under a tighter NDA. No tweets. They could have used a third party instead of hiring through their main website. They could have done a lot more to keep their secret weapon under wraps until it was ready to launch. They could have put their GitHub code in a private repo. And they absolutely should never have expected the MSM or SHFs to play fair. Unless the whole NFT thing is actually bait, RC 5D Chess, this has lost much of its impact when it does eventually get announced.

Fortunately, pre-empting the NFT announcement will do nothing to impair it‚Äôs actual long-term financial impact, we can still expect GME to add another billion or two to it‚Äôs annual revenue over the next year and this means the long-term value of the stock will eventually be multiples of the current share price. All we‚Äôve lost Friday was a catalyst for an early MOASS. So, the only ones who are gonna be salty here is those peeps with options that expire soon. The MOASS is inevitable.

Now I need to revisit one thing from my last article. Since we know Jan 7th was 100% coordinated, I need to mention the content of the options posts we saw them allow onto the sub that-shall-not-be-named. They allowed those posts, that content, possibly bc they are comfortable with the yolo plays it suggests. Jan 21 and Feb 18th $200 Call YOLOs. Go look for yourself. I was holding some of those, now I‚Äôm thinking about moving my options out further and to much lower strikes. On expiration day one ITM option is worth more than a hundred OTM and I don‚Äôt think I like their ‚Äúsuggested‚Äù yolo plays.

I truly don‚Äôt want to step on the turd that is this sub‚Äôs pro/anti-options debate. Fact is the last few months Retail has been a premium pi√±ata, short-dated OTMs wiped out on the weekly. In my opinion, the options debate is dumb. Options aren‚Äôt bad, *losing money is bad*. If you can‚Äôt get your options to print, every $140 DRS‚Äôd share is a guaranteed winning lotto ticket, and you can‚Äôt go wrong with that.

We don‚Äôt know if the MM‚Äôs are actually Delta-hedging our calls, the GEX we often see Tuesdays, post-expiry suggests they aren‚Äôt. Even if calls aren‚Äôt creating pressure, our DRS‚Äôd shares are creating massive piles of FTD‚Äôs cause we see them coming in huge waves from Jan 10th to Jan 21st and beyond. Waves and waves of FTD‚Äôs.

Nuff‚Äô said. Now, let‚Äôs talk about what that little torpedo attack **cost** the MM/SHF‚Äôs bc it did in fact come at a **steep** price.

&#x200B;

[This table make hedgies cry](https://preview.redd.it/lmyi7fh3ava81.jpg?width=1756&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=39bcebfa533ac1a12238e1de571ee7a7f9cb4f86)

**The Options FOMO**

Here is a comparison of the Option Chain for GME on Jan 6th vs Jan 7th. Please get a coffee, sit and stare at for five minutes until you see a picture of a pirate ship emerge.

Friday morning we saw several million bucks fomo into GME at the worst possible time, Implied Volatility was spiking hard making those options super expensive. Just minutes after open them pulled the rug and an absolute crap ton of premium got wiped out in mere minutes as the IV got crushed and all the 0-DTE boys got absolutely fleeced.

Some of us saw it coming if you read my prev DD, but it isn't all bad news bears.

But, 1,889 put contracts were opened on Jan 7th. 4,558 put contracts expired ITM, so have fun with that on T+2 boys. Over 16,000 expired OTM at an average strike of $120 so these were truly some multi-million dollar put walls that got absolutely smashed.

At the end of the Day Friday, we had 2,401 more contracts expire in the money than Jan 6. On Jan 11/12 we can expect 240,000 shares in buy pressure as Gamma exposure comes back to bite any MM‚Äôs who were not appropriately Delta hedging these. We have good reason to believe practically no Call options are being Delta hedged, since their latest ploy appears to be smashing the price action down to drive them all OTM instead of hedging.

Also, there are now an additional 5,668 Call Options are now in the money, representing an additional 566,800 shares of buy pressure for future expiry dates and half of them are Jan 21st strikes, making Jan 25/26 another huge Gamma exposure day for any MM‚Äôs who were not appropriately Delta hedging yesterday. I wish there were more peeps loading up $140 strikes instead of $950‚Äôs, but more danger noodles is more danger noodles.

I gotta wonder, did the MMs/SHFs expect **this much** raw FOMO to hit them in a single day? Even with the IV crush it‚Äôs a MASSIVE amount of capital that came flooding in. Over 8,000 more Calls are now ITM!!

**Vindication of Cycle Theory**

Despite the WSJ FUD on the evening of Jan 6th, what happened Jan 7th was in fact powerful confirmation of Cycle Theory in that we saw huge buy pressure and volume at the T+2/3+6+35c days from Nov 19th, the date we were expecting GME Swaps to roll, expire or fail. They failed and we just witnessed the ‚Äòanomaly‚Äô that occurs in this case and it is very good we finally saw them manifest. More interesting is that this shake out was on the Market Maker T+9+35c ETF FTD schedule. We now know the MM‚Äôs are carrying the bags for the SHF‚Äôs in an act of blatant collusion.

**How big are the Swaps?**

Back on Aug 24+25th we saw volumes of 27.4M. There was 7.3M volume on Nov 19+22, so with and additional 18M vol Jan 6+7th, we now have seen a pretty good indication of how big these suckers are. The swaps have not been closed or covered, otherwise we would have seen a green candle the likes of which mankind has never before witnessed. We only saw them rolling. The swaps are some **fraction** of that 25.3M volume, bc not all the volume on those days would have been a Swap share getting rolled. How could we determine what the fraction is though? Tricky.

So, the 25M got rolled yesterday and we can expect another high-volume day or two on the order of 25M in volume in the future.

**When will Swap day return?**

According to Cycle Theory we had originally expected Swap day on Nov 18th, like we saw Aug 24th, May 25th and other previous dates. But for those of us waiting on the 19th, options at the ready, it simply didn‚Äôt happen. We watched for days wondering if there were extensions, our dates were wrong or something. The roll or expiration of the Swaps is predicated on a counter-party picking up that CME Future and it is entirely possible there no nobody crazy enough to pick up the other side of a 25M GME short position. Duh. The Volatility Swaps are a Citadel/Virtu product, so those likely still exist so long as the options chain suggests a replicating basket exists there to back the swaps.

There wasn‚Äôt much covering Friday, 7.32% gain on 12M volume, just a lot of rolling.

It‚Äôs not XRT, that‚Äôs for sure.

Friday was T+13 for the NYSE Thresholding of XRT. The volume on Friday was a muted 2.7M in XRT. Short volume on XRT was still persistently high at 56%. Not sure what‚Äôs up with that, so we will need to look at the FTDs on XRT for Jan 7th when they are available on Jan31st to see wtf is going on there.

We DID see **huge** short volume on XRT for Jan 4,5 and 6th. This appears to be the ‚Äòlast gasp‚Äô where they abused it as much as possible before T+13 ends the abuse, and looking at the chart, GME got absolutely pummelled on the 4th, 5th and 6th. Expect some positive price action 13 days from the 4th, 5th and 6th. Will be looking at the FTD‚Äôs for these dates also in the next report, expect they will be quite substantial. Coming back in T+13. Thank you Reg Sho!!

This may be the end of cycle theory, as we have known it. All the shorts that were rolled **will be back**, we just don‚Äôt know **when**. What did they roll them into? T+2/3? Spread across other ETF‚Äôs would see them return T+9+35c but I haven‚Äôt found which ETF‚Äôs they are using instead of XRT yet. Will keep looking ‚Ä¶

Disregarding the Jan 7th expiry date, 11,452 new Put options have been opened. Most of them for Jan 21st. The MM‚Äôs/SHF‚Äôs are gearing up for a close quarters battle over the next two weeks. Using Put options like this is a very, very expensive way to suppress the price of a stock bc puts *expire*. This is more desperation.

**Friday we got a drop of blood**

[option? get it? hah](https://preview.redd.it/jbkuab2acva81.jpg?width=615&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0382127b7bbc1d83235f1d5e07bc6c2cf00b3f10)

Something that deserves more attention is the 2M real shares that got borrowed for GME Friday. The SI spiked a massive 20% taking us up to 59% utilization. Using actual GME shares is anathema for SHFs. The last thing they want is articles pointing out how GME is once again rising back up to the 226% SI we had a year ago, triggering fomo en masse.

I haven‚Äôt seen many ppl talk about this, but in my opinion this is HUGE news.

&#x200B;

[Hmm. Smells like desperation or dirty socks.](https://preview.redd.it/mew2otzzcva81.jpg?width=1372&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=af2c64be619ad0e09778eb01aa6421bf10fc3b37)

&#x200B;

**Where did they hide the shorts this time???**

A bunch \~5M probably got hidden in ETF FTDs in XRT the final day or two before the T+13 Threshold limit, so we can expect those to be back in either T+13 if they are following Reg Sho or T+35 if they claim the ETF unwinding.

The rest, I don‚Äôt know actually. I‚Äôve scanned the other ETFs with GME in them and I don‚Äôt see any unusual vol activity. Of course, we won‚Äôt know until we finally get to see the Jan 6/7 FTD data on those ETFs which we won‚Äôt get until Feb 15th.

Could be straight up naked shorts that FTD in T+2(+1), possible but I can‚Äôt believe they are desperate enough they would orchestrate that WSJ article as cover just to buy an extra couple of days.

Answer: No idea where they are hiding shorts and FTD‚Äôs now.

**XRT remains on the Threshold Securities list as of Jan 7th**

Good news, we‚Äôve seen no effort thus far to clear the XRT FTD‚Äôs for five days and get it off the list. Again, on Jan 15th we‚Äôre gonna get the FTDs list for Dec. 16-31st to see how much XRT got abused. Then the Feb 15th drop will show the final days of FTD‚Äôs just before it hit the T+13 limit.

**Endgame Finally?**

We‚Äôve got a ton of FTD‚Äôs from Jan 10th to Jan 21st, a big slug of ETF FTD‚Äôs on the 13th and another one on the 21st. Friday‚Äôs swap FTD volume will return sometime, maybe T+9+35c. Jan 4th ,5th and 6th last gasp of XRT coming back on Jan 26, 27, 28th. There may be a real NFT announcement some day, maybe the 25th which is Etisoppo Yad! Keep an eye on GME borrows, if SI keeps rising over the next two weeks, this is truly the endgame.

With some much stuff about to hit, I think we're gonna have a great week apes, be good to each other. :)

sbadrc,"I worked for a big (American) technology and defense firm with tens of thousands of employees. A senior executive who had worked there successfully for years was caught with a falsification on his r√©sum√©. He was fired immediately, and a new policy was instituted requiring all employees to sign a form giving the company permission to query the college or university with their highest claimed degree for verification.

I have a doctorate from an old prestigious European university, an institution that I was quite sure would have no interest in such a query. But whatever... I signed the permission form and attached a note warning the company that the university would probably ignore the request. Which it did.

After a month or two with no response, HR called me in and said that the university had not responded (as I warned) but that corporate would accept a photocopy of my degree. Fine, I'm good with that.

Remember the ""old, prestigious European university"" part? My degree is a piece of actual parchment about the size of a throw rug, with a wax seal about a centimeter thick, and written entirely in Latin.

So I bring it into the office and photocopy it a bit at a time by sliding it around on the photocopier window. Takes like 12 pages to get it all. I staple them into a pile and give it to HR, who reluctantly pass it on to corporate.

Another month passes. HR calls me in again. ""Corporate is complaining that your degree is written in a foreign language.""

""Yep,"" I say. It's in Latin. ""Tell them to find a priest to translate it."" And walked out. 

Never heard from them again about it.

But now just 6~months later i‚Äôm a little submissive girl who is hungry for cock, i only ever get hard now at the thought of being fucked, or looking at cock and other trans/sissy content on here. I don‚Äôt even get turned on AT ALL when looking at the same nude girls that i would jerk off to not so long ago, my clitty (what i call my dick now) just stays limp and i don‚Äôt get around at all. My mindset has completely changed, i‚Äôm now a complete slut who serves and obeys dick and also dresses like a slut to match it, i guess i class my self as bisexual now because i would still love to serve a domme/mommy but i would only ever get turned on by big throbbing dicks. I have completely changed my algorithm online, with only sissy, trans & dick content ever showing up which my past self would never think of looking at. Now my next step or goal i guess would be to invest in some toys such as a butt plug or a chastity cage which will help me in reaching a sissygasm (unless there‚Äôs any sugar daddy‚Äôs out there jk‚Ä¶ unless hehe).

Being part of the community for literally 20 years, seeing what Live has become, and the Freeshards that have come and gone just makes me wonder what would you all want ideally as far as server settings if population wasn't involved in that equation, since we all know that is probably the most important thing at this point.

In order to not make this post massive, I will simplify my answer here: For me I think it would be somewhere near what Phoenix was, as far as the setting, PvE speed, required farming, templating time, community rules etc. (Honestly that server was pretty great) I would prefer as little instanced content as possible though, make people farm currency in shared/rvr areas, such as DF. I would also prefer class balancing closer to what Celestius is running on. Always loved 1.8x-1.1x patch level the most as far as balancing went, and how the classes played. 

Hot take: ToA would be cool if you could do all the MLs with one group, and get account wide credit to then buy with a Feathers type currency. I like the complexity that ToA added to combat, and templating, but the grind would definitely need to be far less.

sdp9g3,"Season 4 gave us a glimpse into Tory‚Äôs chance for redemption, which I‚Äôm all for. However, there are a number of flaws in this redemption arc:

1. No Remorse

Tory has violated so many people: Miguel, Sam, Demetri, Eli, and the majority of Miyagi Do/Eagle Fang, and has shown not a shred of remorse. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm fully aware that she is a Cobra Kai, and No Mercy is what they practice in real life, but if The Big Three want us to root for Tory - which I didn‚Äôt this season - then they need to make her the bigger person. If she is ever to be truly free, Tory needs to apologise to everyone she‚Äôs hurt, especially Sam.

2. Her Family

If Tory‚Äôs mother is dying, wouldn‚Äôt she be wanting to spend every minute with her? I have a bad feeling that in Season 5, Tory will be too busy focusing on Cobra Kai, that she‚Äôll neglect her mother and her brother. While she‚Äôs succeeding, her family is disintegrating. And dare I say it, Tory‚Äôs mother will not survive, leaving Tory with no one left.

3. Lack of Punishment

Again - I know Tory‚Äôs a Cobra Kai, and they don‚Äôt believe in showing mercy, but if she wants to catch a break, then she needs to be held responsible for her actions. Let‚Äôs look at Tory‚Äôs history: she‚Äôs tried to murder Sam - twice (which Sam did not deserve to happen to her, and swipe past, if you think she did), she wanted Hawk to break Demetri‚Äôs arm (didn‚Äôt try and stop it, and even enjoyed it, once it happened), caused and led a home invasion into the LaRusso‚Äôs house (bullied Sam into a corner - literally - and violated her safety), and on top of that, Tory got away with it all.

Again, I want to make it clear that I want Tory to find redemption and be a better person, but to not even have her show any remorse or sorrow, just shows that she hasn‚Äôt earned it.

s9qaij,"So my GF and I have dated for just barely 3 years. She has met my immediate family and but she has never met my extended family.

So we have a tradition where once a month my grandmother hosts a Sunday dinner for the entire family at her estate. We all show up and if you‚Äôre old enough to use a stove you cook. 

My girlfriend has never attended until very recently, the first time she did was in December prior to Christmas. This is because my grandmother would prefer to not have non family and partners that haven‚Äôt been around for a while present. 

When she attended in December, I got word that my grandmother didn‚Äôt approve of her choice of clothing and won‚Äôt welcome her back if she doesn‚Äôt dress better. My aunt told me that grandma thought she dressed, ‚Äúwhorish‚Äù. Now I fully disagree and so did my family and my aunt. My girlfriend was admittedly dressed slightly less conservative than the other women but I wouldn‚Äôt call what she was wearing immodest at all.

So I told my girlfriend and asked her if she would dress more conservatively next time. So come January the dinner is this Sunday. I wanted to not have a repeat of what happened last time as I want her to get FaceTime with my family. 

I asked my girlfriend to show me her dress before this weekends. She did and the dress was less conservative. Again, it wasn‚Äôt immodest, but just less conservative and I know it‚Äôd piss my grandmother off again. She said no as she really liked the dress and it was modest. I told her that what‚Äôs modest to her isn‚Äôt going to be what‚Äôs modest to a 89 year old woman. I told her if she wanted to buy a dress I‚Äôd pay for it. 

She refused. After some arguing she proved that she was not going to budge. I told her that I‚Äôd she didn‚Äôt change it would be better if she just not show up and we try to find a solution for next month. She then said she wasn‚Äôt getting a different dress and I told her that it‚Äôs best she not come and I‚Äôd go without her.

She told me I was being unreasonable and putting an old woman‚Äôs outdated views over her freedom. I feel like I was being very reasonable.

Putting aside arguments for or against quotas, I want to propose that *if* we accept quotas as a good thing, they should be going to groups that are the most disadvantaged. Not women.

Probably the most disadvantaged group in Australia, that intersects with every other demographic, is the poor people. The poorest people have the worst health outcomes, lowest education attainment, lowest life expectancy, highest rates of criminality and highest of being victims of criminality.

 It has been mentioned, but the toxicity and abuse towards the sub, within the sub, and towards other subs has been too high. We as moderators have our share of blame in this, but we want to stress that this kind of behavior is not acceptable and we are taking these measures primarily to avoid these things. We want /r/reddevils to be a place where anyone and everyone is welcome to discuss and enjoy the best club on earth without fear of abuse or ridicule.

&#x200B;

Which leads us to 2 other small reminders. The report button is your friend, we are way more likely to find and remove and/or ban rule breaking comments if you report them. The downvote button is not a ""I disagree or don't like your statement button"", better discussion is generally had by using the upvote button more liberally and avoiding the downvote one whenever possible.

s93c5w,"Four months ago, the question was asked, ""Would a Hardcore raid be able to kill Ragnaros?""

So the ultimate community challenge was born, and we started down the Road to Ragnaros.

Season of Mastery brought unexpected challenges. Blizzard doubled the hp of every Molten Core boss, and added brand new mechanics to every fight. In the effort to learn more about these new difficulties, a ragtag band of Hardcore players tried Molten Core on the PTR, and were able to be the first players in the world to kill Ragnaros there. Emboldened, we put the final stamp of approval on pitting our Hardcore community against this even more exciting and brutal challenge in the Season of Mastery mode of Molten Core.

Launch has brought our community together to persevere and to thrive on this crazy (to others) mode of play. Hardcore has given us the best and the worst of the wow community. There has been laughter and tears, joy and heartache. New friendships have been forged, often in the heat of the toughest dungeons (we're looking at you Gnomer).  Guildies celebrate the smallest of victories, and gather around to commemorate the fallen. I think it's safe to say the Hardcore experience on SOM has been a memorable one for many, and we hope, for all the right reasons.

Out of a community of over 10,000 players all over the world, 12 guilds, over 800 level 60s, immense numbers of farmers and crafters, and a lot of determined heart - we are finally here at the start of the end of our goal - a full Molten Core clear attempt and a Ragnaros kill.

This weekend, at 1pm Pacific Time on Saturday 22nd January, the NA Elite crew will be attempting a 10/10 full clear of Molten Core.

Please join us as Kargoz and Winky broadcast the effort live on Twitch here:

[https://www.twitch.tv/kargozgaming](https://www.twitch.tv/kargozgaming)

Hardcore has been an active WOW Community mode for 2 years, with players on Classic ERA, Classic TBC and now Season of Mastery. The EU continues to work towards a Molten Core clear and with so many players ambitiously striving to raid, it's likely we will continue to see ongoing raids in the future. Hardcore will continue to run as normal on SOM and into the future for Classic WOW. Thank you all for being so incredible.

First of all, lets not waste time, here's the Interactive CYOA, click it then come back here, it takes a while to load you'll have time to read this post then: [Crossdimensional Harem Interactive CYOA V1.0](https://shardonic.neocities.org/Crossdimensional/index.html)

Yes, that blank screen means its loading. Gonna take a few seconds to a full minute, possibly more. I went overboard with the thing.

Quick word, don't hesitate to mention in a comment if you've encountered problems playing this CYOA. This is a pretty complex beast, so there are probably still bugs despite ample testing.

&#x200B;

Anyway, this is the interactive version of this here CYOA: [Crossdimensional Harem V2.1](https://imgur.com/a/8CS36Wx), by **Minimorrigu**, who isn't on Reddit anymore for reasons, so I don't know how to contact them. Oh well. I'll have to ask for forgiveness, somehow.

Major differences include: 18 new girls available, for a total of 270, said girls have been properly arranged by colors and tagged with an individual \[ID\] for ease of use, Artefact, Mutation and Class have been folded into the Set system, Followers have been deleted, about 90% of the pictures have been changed, the new section ""Combos"" has been added, a ""Summary"" section has been added at the end so you can see clearly everything you've chose, a great many systems for improved gameplay have been added, and more I probably forget.

Time to check on the CYOA to see if its loaded. If not, come back here, I've got a load more to tell !

&#x200B;

So, quickly, how to play: you choose a harem package, after you've read the intro preferably, which determines how many harem members you get, but also how easy bonuses are to get (with the more harem members you have the more difficult it is, obviously).

Then you go to the Harem Selection Area, and you click on Open Team {Color}, and then you make your choices ! This might take some back and forth as you hesitate between the choices available, but worry not, there are lists right before the harem selection to cut down your time spent looking for the girl of your dreams !

And then once you've made you choice, you go to the bonuses to see what you've unlocked. If you're unsatisfied, feel free to go back and change your selection of harem members; and if you unlocked Team Rainbow, you'll pretty much have to go back to the Harem Selection Area. Team Rainbow makes the game even more complex, and I've spent a good chunk of my time to try to make it work properly; which I believe it does, but just in case, if it doesn't, comment on this post so I fix it; the temporary fix being just to deselect and reselect the offending choice, usually.

At the end, you can click the summary button at the end to see all the things you've selected at once without having to go back.

Anyway, it should be loaded now. If it's still not loaded, come back again...

&#x200B;

So, this was to be a simple project that turned out to be massive. Outside of the visible, playable parts, I've got about a thousand choices running in the background to make stuff work, along with point systems up the wazoo.

If you want numbers, Interactive CYOA maker tells me I've got 419012 characters, 1846 choices, 445 images, 158 rows, and I count 119 point systems, for a total of about 54.7Mo (which should explain the load time). Been working on this for a little over a month.

I've also developed logic gates within the CYOA to help with Team Rainbow, pretty painful to set up properly but very useful once in place.

Seriously though, unless you're stuck with internet from 1997 this should be loaded by now, I'm running out of things to say...

&#x200B;

So...weather's nice this time of the year, don't you think ?","Crossdimensional Harem Interactive V1.0 ! 270 Potential Harem Members available, Bonus Perks, Sets, Combos, and more ! (OC) (Very Long) (Takes a while to load, be patient)",2.0,2.0

s7sv4y,"I originally posted in AITA and learned about this sub reddit 

A few months ago I gave birth and we lost our son due to many labor complications at the time the original issue took place I was recovering and still in the post-p period (for context)

I (19f) have been with my husband (20m) for 5 years married for 2 and his (42f) mom recently told us exactly how she feels about me and our relationship she never expressed a problem with us before but ,essentially it started because she thought we were calling her a bad mom when saying my husbands kid brother (12m) was old enough to walk home (10 mins) and stay home alone for 30 mins we tried to tell her that's not what we were doing and she went off specifically on me. She then told my husband that nothing was his fault and they were proud of him it ended with her saying all the hardships he has encountered in life were because of me, Im not good for him, I always pretend after a fight with her that everything is OK and don't solve anything, im the reason our son is gone, im a whore, he shouldn't be with me, Im only going to be here a little while to make him a better man for someone else, a gold digger, I never listen and, etc her reasonings for those insults me and my husband both agree are ridiculous 

Now to the issue since this was all right before the holidays I've had to grit and bear it through family functions with her. Me not hugging her at these functions aren't too weird as they all know I dislike touching but my not even looking at her only acknowledging when Necessary and having a cold demeanor toward her has been noticeable at least to the cousins our age and younger. (The adults often ignore problems) So this is where I might be the AH she keeps pushing like everything is ok and I keep pushing back she has apologized but that was purely to get information from us as she tends to need to know what's going on ( my labor and stay in the hostipal was intense because of her) so when she's acting as though things are OK I remind her they aren't whether we are in front of people or not I told her where I stood after the apology but I don't think she expected me to stand my ground like this and I feel like she's becoming sad about it when we see eachother.She did scream at me because she said I pretend things are better when they aren't. I'm not sure if I should go easier now or not, all I know is at very least I'm petty but, AITA  

TLDR MIL and I get in to a fight and the aftermath she asked for  persists and she's upset about it

To clear things up from AITA My MIL had been pretty great until this and once before this 

Currently I'm sorta grey rocking her 

My husband did in fact defend me and always has and presumably always will 

Also if anyone wants to know her reasonings for the insults I can tell u or edit and post it but they are again ridiculous 

Edited to include more details 

Will update about recently later just wanted to get the post out

OK since some people are coming for my husband he originally wanted to go NC I convinced him otherwise so we could preserve our relationship with his dad and younger brother 

He dis not drag or force me to the family events mentioned I wanted to go as he has a very large family and it's rare we get to see all of his cousins we are close with 

Because it was a large event it was easy to ignore and not to be around her through it 

We did recently spend her birthday with her (again a family event with more than just his immediate family there) but we did so because his dad called us and asked us to 

No one come for his dad for that either his dad has been through alot and works hard to keep his family together his dad and mom have marital issues as it isthen.

Hubby edit: me and my wife talked about whether the autistic thing was relevant and it's really only relevant to the comment. She knows I can make decisions and all that good jazz.

My wife forgot to admit that my cousins are children below the age of 13 so we only see them at family functions. The older cousins all live for away so we also don't typically see them.

I'm posting a comment my husband posted because I did in fact totally forget to mention tht my B also the older cousins we still talk to alot during the year via phone calls and texts they are also about our age I once went to school with them both so we all know eachother but they work very far away from where we live now and he has 2 cousins one way older and one a bit younger tht lives here tht we see and neither of them really go to family events

Update for anyone still following along my husband and i have cut contact as of yesterday I decided to take the advice of the people in the comments and let my husband handle it as he saw fit 

I'm not sure how to upload pics but if I figure it out I'm going to post the pics of the messages 

Advance notice the comment my husband makes in the texts about the laundry is simply that she thinks my husband does everything like a slave and tht he isn't independent and only listens to me rather than doing things of his own volition (very not true I love him but he is stubborn as a mule and likes some things his way but marriage is about compromise so somethings I just gotta let go and vice versa) 

The only reason my husband and I think she thinks this is because when i was pregnant with our son my husband didn't let me do anything practically aside from making dinner and tidying up (I was high risk to begin with due to my other previous pregnancy losses) and my husbands very protective of me and at the time our unborn son but carrying a heavy laundry basket to the laundry room then climbing in to the washer half way to reach everything at the bottom was too much for me so I left it to him (I'm very short so I can't reach the bottom on my own well)

Thts the only place we can think she got it from the comment was just a simple snide remark I wasn't present for but this is what I got from what he told me 

His grandmother asked if we were going to do laundry (we live close to them and do laundry there as we don't have our own machines) his mom said wouldn't it just be (husbands name and looking at him) or is (my name) gonna help in a condescending tone (according to husband) originally he said she asked about me and he said I was asleep to limit my contact with her and she made this comment after he defended me by saying I do help but it was bothering him all day and he told me about it and we talked and he decided now was a good time to cut her off and this time I listened and told him if this is what he thinks and feels then I support him 100% and that I loved him 

After tht he sat alone at the table a while while figuring out what to text her and say to her (per his request I left him to do it on his own as he thought tht was what he needed) we hadn't responded to any messaged from her for a few months now) 

All I can really say is she didn't take it well and we hadn't felt her really trying to amend things as she claims she has but maybe the way she amends things just isn't how we do and how we perceive it to not even know she was attempting or trying to do so

rysyei,"Background info: I‚Äôve been dating each for about 3 months, and have been planning a vacation with each of them for the last couple days. One of my gfs lives a few hours from me, while the other lives very close. 

Detailed plan:

I plan on booking a resort in FL for 7 days. For the first 3 days, I will fly and meet the gf who lives further away from me at the resort. Since we live in different cities with their own airports, it wouldn‚Äôt be suspicious to suggest to her that we take different flights and meet at the resort. 

This half of the vacation is the least risky in my opinion since we‚Äôll both arrive on the same day and will check into the room together.

When it‚Äôs time for her to fly back, I will tell her that my flight is a few hours after hers, and so I will wait at the resort. I will then call her an uber to the airport and will tell her I‚Äôll text her when I leave for my flight.

I will also coordinate with the other gf to make sure she arrives in FL AFTER my other gf leaves the resort. 

Prior to the trip, I will tell my second gf that I‚Äôll be in FL for a few days before her to visit family members and that I‚Äôll meet her at the resort, and that we‚Äôll fly back to our city together.

When she arrives at the resort, I‚Äôll tell her that I already checked in. I will make sure room service cleans my room SPOTLESS before she comes. This will be the same exact room I will stay in with my other gf. I can ask for a new room, but feel like it‚Äôs kind of kinky to make the second gf sleep in the same bed as my other gf. 

After the second gf arrives at the resort, I believe there is no longer any risk. We will enjoy the resort together and leave together on the same flight. My biggest concern is making sure the first gf leaves the resort early in the day and the second gf comes at least an hour after the other one leaves. If there is any overlap I will be finished.

Thoughts on my plan? Any holes or anything I didn‚Äôt think through? And don‚Äôt lecture me on having multiple gfs. The concept of only dating one girl at a time is outdated due to girls being highly emotional decision makers and willing to leave relationships just because they no longer feel butterflies- cannot risk putting all my eggs in one basket. If girls were as committed to relationships as guys, I wouldn‚Äôt have to do this.","Currently have 2 gfs who don‚Äôt know about each other and want to travel to FL for a week; 3 days with one gf, and 4 days with the other.

s3szo8,"We are just starting on our solar journey and are a bit confused by the estimated generation numbers.  The first two quotes to come in are from Tesla and a local company that did our neighbor's house.

||Tesla|Local Company|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Size|16.4 kW|15.8 kW|
|System|41 Panels (400W)|44 Hanwha Q-Cells Q.PEAK DUO BLK-G10+ 360 with Enphase IQ7PLUS-72-2-US|
|Estimated Energy Production|16,587 kWh/yr|17,537 kWh/yr|
|Installed Cost|$34,604|$46,728|
|Upfront Solar Renewable Energy Credit|\-$12,628|$0|
|Federal Tax Credit|\-$5,714|\-$12,149|
|Net Cost|$16,262|$34,579|
|Solar Renewable Energy Credits Per Year|$0|$1,574/yr for 15 years|

The layouts are pretty much exactly the same, spread between East, South and West facing roofs. The local company wanted to do a bigger system with panels on the North facing roof, but my wife doesn't want panels on the front of our house.

So, our first question is how does the estimated energy production vary by about 1,000 kWh/yr? Is it efficiency of the system or differences in how they estimate production?

Second, with time value of money, why would I put up twice as much money upfront for the local company rather than go with Tesla and invest the rest of the money?

Let me describe my wife, she is hot and beautiful as you might have guessed by looking pics on my profile.. she is extremely homely and been with only me.. we were in relationship since 10 years prior to marriage..

So I started developing cuck(stag) desires after 5 years of relationship..  but she dint approve of it.. I asked her to do it once but she always refused.. couple of times she agreed to roleplay but not in real . She dint shake hands with other boys leave alone sleeping.( May be this caused my cuck desires).. then during our long distance relationship, I asked her to write stories for me where she have sex with other guys.. I read them and jerk off . And let her know that how much I liked it..

I use to convince her on a regular basis.. meanwhile we got married.. and I finally convinced her to date, luckily at the same time her old crush arrived and I encouraged her to meet him.. date him.. slowly he conveyed her feelings and they start to chat more naughty.. it started with a movie where he touched her first time.. I use to sit in theatre and watch them from distance.. as he touch my wife.. press her boobs and finger her.. ( I can't see clearly what they are doing, but my wife use to tell me).. 

And then they use to go for long drive and I use to follow them and from distance use to see what they are doing.. one day they went to a hotel and I have to wait patiently, after 6 hours my wife came back and said they had sex.. 

Her BF doesn't know that she use to tell me everything.. I asked her to click some photos which she did last time..

sfym8w,"Alright so as the title says I am a mess right now. I asked close friends but I want to see what other people without an emotional connection might make of this situation.

This will be a long post so for that I am sorry I will try to add a TL;DR at the bottom.

I will start by saying that I am not American but I am a foreigner. I speak English well and can speak Spanish but not a lot of Japanese.

In December 17th I went on a trip back to my home country in Europe to see family and friends as with Corona and everything I have been stuck in Japan for soon to be 3 years. This idea of going is actually something that my wife brought up as she felt bad for me not seeing family for so long.
I came back to Japan on January 11th and did the whole quarantine procedure. We have a small kid with us of 1 year and 4 months. After the quarantine stay at a hotel (decided to stay in a hotel so the kid can continue kindergarten without problems) is when the trouble started.

I came back home Wednesday 26th, I was a bit shock as the house was a bit of a mess (lots of cans of alcohol on the sink, packages of snacks everywhere, bed being a mess, dirty clothes around, etc). I thought it was maybe because my wife was taking care of our son by herself so it was a bit understandable. She has been having friends over in the house to party and play games on the Nintendo switch and this she told me.

After seeing this mess I decided to clean a bit while my wife was away with our soon. I had a gut feeling already that something was up and that‚Äôs when I discovered a bag inside the garbage that had a used condom, the condom‚Äôs package and a toothbrush.

After such a discovery my whole world shattered, I felt like throwing up and my legs were shacking. I could not think straight and could not understand what happened.

I decided to keep calm, I hid the evidence and decided to talk about it the next day once our son was in kindergarten. I did not want to argue or fight or cry in front of our son.

Next day I dropped our son to kindergarten and decided to grab the evidence I had and go talk to her parents.

Once the parents saw what I had they were devastated. I know who the person she cheated with is also. It‚Äôs a friend that I hanged out with many times. He is Japanese.

After that her dad came with me home to mediate so we could talk about this.

She admitted to have cheated and also confirmed that she cheated with the person I thought off.

Now comes the hardest part and probably the hardest decision I had to make until now.

She is asking for forgiveness and her grandma is also asking for forgiveness but I am not sure I can do that.

I saw only 1 condom but for all I know they could have had sex for all the time I was away. Also finding this in the garbage could mean it was very recent and it happened while I was here already doing quarantine.

I said that in order to forgive her and try to fix the relationship I needed proof of 3 things:

1) that this was a 1 off thing only and it didn‚Äôt happen multiple times.
2) that it was not premeditated or planned and it just happened (they were drunk or whatever)
3) that there are not feeling between the two of them.

For this I asked her to share her phone conversation with the guy for the past 2 or 3 months so I could see that they did not talk about feelings or decided to meet up for sex , etc. She said she deleted the conversation and does not have a backup which means the only option left for me is to trust that she is saying the truth and move on? (Which I don‚Äôt think I can).

What my brain is telling me tho is to move on, get a divorce (I visited a lawyer already with the evidence , etc) and to simply try to stay near my son so he can have a life as close to normal as possible.

I don‚Äôt hate her and I will work together if she is capable of in order for our son to be able to spend time with the both of us equally and I won‚Äôt talk I‚Äôll of her, etc. what‚Äôs done is done and that bullshit won‚Äôt help my kid in anyway.

What are your thoughts? 

I am a bit scared I live in a rural area and my Japanese is not very good, luckily I work remote and I have a good salary so money should not be a huge issue.

TL;DR: came home from a visit to my home country to find that my wife has cheated with a friend. She is asking for forgiveness but when I asked her to let me see her phone or any proof to know that this was only a 1 time off thing and that there are no feelings between them she said she did not have the chat anymore. She does not have a backup either or any way to show me any profs that this only happened once and it was not a premeditated action. I am now considering divorce (already went to a lawyer) but the whole situation is a bit scary because we have a kid (1 year old and 4 months) and my Japanese is not that good. What should I do? I am doing the right thing if I continue with the divorce? 

Thanks you for reading this I know it‚Äôs very long.

Edit: fixed some typos.


Update: 

Alright I tried to read as many comments as possible and reply as much as well. 

Yesterday I wanted to test the ground a little bit with her and I mentioned the idea of having her contribute more economically from now on. She did not take that very nicely, she even went as far as to want to cancel some of the plans we already have (like going to have dinner with some friends) if she had to pay half the tab. Obviously this is a hugeeeeee red flag and confirms what many of you said here already and what I think I already knew but did not want to admit. It‚Äôs even weird because e before all this she would sometimes help but now after doing this I get such a strong reaction. I may need to accept already that she probably doesn‚Äôt love me anymore so there is nothing to save here. 
She is not sorry, she does not regret it, she is just upset that I caught her and the strong reaction I get from her is mostly at the idea of her having to go through divorce, live by herself and having to work to pay for things again (plus probably the shame and stigma from being divorced that Japanese society seems to have).

I will look for myself and my son from now on. Healing should be priority and then I will try to proceed carefully.

I decided that divorce is the only way. I could forgive her with time but I don‚Äôt want to be with her anymore and I don‚Äôt think she deserves to be with me neither. 

I think divorce will also be a suiting punishment. She wanted to have a second kid (well that won‚Äôt happen no more). We live in a small town so eventually people will know what happened or at least that we divorced. So she will have to live with that as well. 

Now as many people here mentioned it seems that in order to go for divorce I will have to play my cards right and even then things could get sour fast. But I need to at least give it a try.

I have the evidence in a bag hidden in my car (will probably move it to somewhere safer until I can hand it over to a lawyer if that is possible), I also took pictures and videos showing the evidence and how I found it and made several backups of it.

I took pictures as well if all the cans, the messy kitchen and the bags of garbage full of cans to use it to mention she has been partying while I was away.

So I guess what is left is to keep a cool head, discuss everything with my lawyer and try to see if I can keep custody and offer here equal visitation rights.

I will try to be nice in the mean time and only make a move once I am sure it is safe to do so.

I will get in touch with the BAR association on my prefecture and see if there is any luck getting a lawyer that speak a English or Spanish. 

I also contacted my embassy to see if they could help me getting in touch with a lawyer or some counseling or something.

Once this whole thing it‚Äôs over I think me and my son will be fine.

He also stares at me everyday during our breaks as I chat with friends, and I feel like he listens to our convos.
He seems awkward & a bit rude when we do talk though, he keeps things super quick and one-worded responses.

the sub is being brigaded by antivaxers on this subject. 

Therefore, we will be using a megathread to group the posts on the convoy to avoid this topic taking over the sub. As before, some explanations of how this will work:

* Anyone creating a post about the protest who does not have a significant history with this sub will be **banned**, no questions asked. If you do have a history with this community, the post will be removed and you will be warned.
* This community is about OTTAWA, not Covid nor the related restrictions. Remember that.
* Any links or pictures to their propaganda will be removed. Do not give them publicity.
* I will be watching the megathread. Remember that disinformation/misinformation about covid is [a violation of the site wide rule #1](https://old.reddit.com/r/ottawa/comments/retftg/why_was_this_comment_deleted_what_rules_were/hoalv3g/).

Have at it folks, but remember, the usual rules apply. Please keep it civil and report anyone posting misinformation or links to their propaganda.

sftsla,"Back at the height of SPAC mania after getting in and out of a bunch of SPACS, the one that I managed to hold on to with a significant position was GSAH which is now MIR. After bravely clinging on to $10 for a while, it did manage to tank with the rest of the market and is now trading at $7.50. My thoughts on why it went down is that it probably got lumped with everything else and got whacked by de-SPAC shorting.

Of course it's depressing to see the paper loss but the reasons why I still hold on are:

1. Eventually this overcrowded de-SPAC shorting trade has to unwind
2. It's boring. It's probably the least sexy de-SPAC ever and maybe that's a plus in today's risk averse climate
3. Goldman doesn't get the full promote shares till it hits $16 (someone confirm this). They have an incentive to get this going

edit: found the relevant section in the GSAH docs

""*Note: GSAH II promote shares are deferred with a vesting term of 5 years, and with 1/3rd* *vesting at $12.00/share, 1/3rd* *vesting at $14.00/share, and 1/3rd* *vesting at $16.00/share. The sponsor may vote the promote shares while unvested with dividends deferred until vesting.""*

1. Not especially affected by business cycles or declining consumer demand.
2. As of the most recent quarterly filings it still has 60% institutional ownership which sounds pretty good and GS is the biggest holder.

Are there other MIR holders who have thoughts on what the path to recovery looks like for this one? Are there other super boring but stable de-SPAC bargains to pick up in this indiscriminate shorting?",Any one still in GSAH --->> MIR? Thoughts on this and others like it,2.0,2.0

* For each rate you have three options: give a thumbs up, a thumbs down or a neutral. The definitions for each are provided are the top of the form. The data from these questions will be compiled to give an ""approval rating"" which will be partially what we select the rates based off of. You can also abstain from answering any rate if you have no feelings whatsoever, but this removes your opinion entirely from that rate idea.
* Then, list up to five of the rates that you consider your favorite ideas by copy pasting the titles. The data from these questions will be compiled into a different metric that will also be used to select the rates.
* Finally, if you are interested in hosting a rate this cycle, select which rates you want to host. I've included what I assume the three most common stances are as default options but there's also an ""Other"" text box that you can copy paste specific rate titles into. Rates in need of hosts have ""(Co-)Host needed"" at the bottom of their descriptions.
* Generally, the seven most popular rate ideas across both metrics will be picked. However, we will also consider how the selected rates play off of each other, in an effort to ensure some level of diversity across all categories (genre, race, gender, etc.)
* Rate ideas from active rate participants who are enthusiastic about hosting are more likely to be picked. Likewise, rate ideas from negative presences in the community are less likely to be picked.
* If you're a prospective host, check out [THIS](https://redd.it/q0xwmq) post for some advice!

Without further ado, [HERE](https://forms.gle/HX5CeC27vwXB5d3XA) is the form where you do everything. **Voting will close at noon EST this Thursday, January 20th.**

sa8b2h,"Hello!

I have a very close friend who comes from Azerbaijan. Amongst other things, we also talked about things like culture, relationships, and physical intimacy in dating.

I was told that in Azeri culture, it's generally considered normal to date without sex (if there is any dating at all), and that it is unacceptable to have sex before marriage. Supposedly, if the family found out, it could mean the end of relationships with the family for the woman, possibly danger, and that it would also damage the reputation of the family of the woman.

I hope this doesn't come across in any negative way. I come from a different culture and I want to learn more about where my friend comes from and what her background is.

If you don't mind me asking, is what I have described above an experience that you would confirm, or is it more individual? How would you describe your dating culture and the implications of physical intimacy to somebody who grew up in a different culture?

sffept,"Hi reddit,

I (27 yo) have been seeing a girl (20 yo, divorced with a baby) for over 8 months, we never dated, we had a convo about it last may, but I said I couldn‚Äôt accept the baby and after that we occasionally spent time together, watched movies and had sex. I felt that she was committed to me and she would come whenever I asked, I felt that I was getting attached to her, that‚Äôs why I was seeing with other girls, with just a few sexual encounters. 

I had this intuitional suspiciousness about her doing something behind my back, but never had any proofs, she was available almost 24/7. Last fall she started catching feelings as I assume, she would occasionally call and cry over the phone about her future and her feeling lonely. 

In November a friend of mine was looking for a hook up girl and he was offered her. I came to her, she cried and told me she just started doing it and only had one call which in the end got cancelled and she never worked as a prostitute. I had tough time getting over it but after a few days we met and overall the relationship got better and we starred spending even more times together, although I had great amount of stress whenever she wasn‚Äôt with me and wouldn‚Äôt reply to me. She told me she cares about me a lot and never see other guys and don‚Äôt even want to talk to someone but me. 

A month ago, I decided that it can‚Äôt continue like this with this on and offs and it‚Äôs time to act, I told her they now on, we act as a couple and always be open and tell about our feelings and everything, she agreed. 
After the new year it naturally happened that we started spending every night together and wouldn‚Äôt only see each other during work time, but somehow I felt that my anxiety is only growing. Then last week I received more proofs of her being a prostitute and came to her, this time it was solid, again she didn‚Äôt admit, we spent a few days discussing it, she even broke her phone. I was so down I came to her and offered her doing cocaine, I don‚Äôt do it often and we never did together but this time i couldn‚Äôt handle the stress. That was when she admitted, she told me that she had been doing it for a year after she broke up with her husband and she needed money to pay rent and send money to her grandma who lived with her baby, she wasn‚Äôt looking for a relationship when we met, she wanted to get some money out of me, but I resisted, lately she started catching feelings for me and it was hitting hard on her that‚Äôs why she found a job as a correspondent in 
December and was planning to quit having sex for money and in January didn‚Äôt have any encounters. So we spent 3 days doing cocaine and just sitting at home together as I felt that it would be easier for me to get over it. I know she had a chance to stop it before if she wanted and that people don‚Äôt change. I have some hope she won‚Äôt do it again and she would change as all make mistakes. But at the same time I‚Äôm suspicious that she‚Äôs telling and doing everything possible now to keep me and not to let me leave. I told her we will stop communicating anyway, but I will spend a few days with her just to support her, although I need the support as well. I know if I eat it up and make a mistake, next time it will hit me 10 times harder. I sincerely sorry for her life and destiny and I think I could help her.

TLDR: I was seeing a girl for almost a year and it appeared that she is a prostitute. She told me she won‚Äôt do it again and won‚Äôt have sex for money. But I don‚Äôt have trust in her.","I (27, m) have been seeing a girl (20) who appeared to be a prostitute",2.0,2.0

-   GAME NOTES

The St. Louis Blues will begin a five-home stand - their longest of the season - on Friday night when they host the Washington Capitals at Enterprise Center.

Vladimir Tarasenko, Scott Perunovich and Jake Walman were added to the League's COVID protocols on Thursday - giving Blues Head Coach Craig Berube just one game with a fully-healthy group of forwards. As a result, Berube will need to make some lineup adjustments for Friday's game against the Capitals.

The Blues are tied for the League lead with 254 points from its forwards, including an NHL best 156 assists.  The Blues have points in 10 straight home games since Nov. 18 (9-0-1) and are second only to the Florida Panthers in points collected at home since Nov. 18.

s4ssj3,"I went to [Horse Market](http://horsemarketsf.com) in San Francisco for the first time last night, and oh my fucking God it was the most mind-blowing experience I‚Äôve ever had. It's a sex party imported from Berlin, and the main idea is that a group of ‚Äúmares‚Äù (bottoms) are hooded while ‚Äústallions‚Äù (tops) take turns fucking them for hours. You have to choose one role and you can‚Äôt ever change it. Sounds pretty straightforward, but holy shit I wasn‚Äôt prepared for what I experienced. This is my account of the evening‚Äôs events.

Mares arrived first around 5:30 pm and were hooded right away in their holding/rest area. Stallions arrived shortly after. We had our own area where we undressed and checked our clothes in. Around 7 pm as soon as the mares were ready, the host shouted something like, ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs ready to fuck some ass?‚Äù The other naked stallions and I then marched noisily into the play area. 

What we saw was absolutely insane. There was a giant bed in the middle of a huge room, about 15 mares were just lined up on all fours or on their backs, legs spreadeagled. Around the bed, there were slings and other furniture with about 10-15 more mares perfectly positioned for hardcore fucking. All the mares were hooded and they were strictly forbidden from removing their hoods or even taking a peek or they would be forced to leave. If they needed anything‚Äîlike to get some water, go to the bathroom, be moved to a different location, they just had to raise their hand and one of the ‚Äústable hands‚Äù (volunteers) would approach them. There was an iPad by the refreshment area where stallions could vote for their favorite mares.

The other stallions and I began pounding to the beat of roaring techno music. I usually like to get sucked off to get in the right headspace, but this time I was just so excited that I grabbed the first sexy mare I could get my hands on and started pounding like my life depended on it. The sex was incredibly hot, not mechanical at all. Pure raw carnal lust unleashed.

The guys were so hot‚Äîboth stallions and mares. Like pornstar levels in terms of sexiness and performance. Jocks and bears and twinks and twunks and otters‚Äîyou name it. The entire party looked like it was taken straight from a porn site. I actually did end up fucking a porn star all night‚Äîa muscle jock that was voted best mare at the last Horse Market. He was on his A-game while he took dick over and over and over‚ÄîI was so impressed that I rewarded him with one of my loads.

The mares rotated between locations every now and then while us stallions moved around sticking our dicks into as many asses as we could. I heard the ratio was 2 stallions for every mare, but there wasn‚Äôt a single moment that a mare wasn‚Äôt available to me. Every hole was different but they all felt incredible hugging my cock as I pounded them. There was one mare who particularly liked sucking cock and he was just on his knees most of the night while stallions fed him their cocks right after fucking other mares in the ass.

At about 9:45 pm it was down to 1 mare and 1 stallion‚Äîthis beautiful bottom with the most perfect bubble butt and smooth lightly tanned skin that glistened in the dim light, and me! I had him at the perfect angle while I grabbed his twinky body close to me and I pounded away until I finally delivered my third load into his leaking hole. The organizer shouted, ‚ÄúAnd that was the last load of the night!‚Äù All the stable hands were gathered around our sling and applauded us while my mare and I groaned and moaned in ecstasy. The organizer put his hand on my shoulder as I was cumming inside my mare, and he said, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it. Take all the time you need. Enjoy this beautiful moment with your mare.‚Äù It was a fucking awesome end to a perfect night!

After I got home I was still horny so I went to the porn star‚Äôs motel room, fucked him together with three other insanely hot tops, and gave him my fourth load.

Tonight I‚Äôm going back to pound and breed more holes. I am so proud and grateful to be a whore.

======

UPDATE: Thanks for the Silver award! I‚Äôm glad to know many found this post useful and hot lol. Just as a response to all the guys asking about similar parties in SF:

As I posted elsewhere:

Most commercial sex parties are held in the same venue: Transform1060, formerly SF Catalyst. Check out the 442 events especially their Cumunion parties. They‚Äôre similar to Horse Market but with no rigid rules, like the bottoms aren‚Äôt hooded and there are no strict roles. There is a kink group called Unleashed that holds events in the same venue.

A couple of blocks away, Powerhouse has a smoking area in the back where people fuck while other people are smoking or chatting. One night I was there banging a cub from behind, and there was this loud Asian girl who was with her White gay friend and they just kept laughing and chatting while paying no mind to the fucking that was going on around them. And it was a pretty tight space. I could hear them gossip about coworkers as I pulled my cub‚Äôs harness and pumped his ass. 

Folsom Gulch, also in Soma, is a sex shop that has a gay arcade where guys cruise. This is a more rugged blue collar kind of experience with an older and more DL crowd. I once had some great head there fron a very talented and obedient cocksucker. 

Then there are private sex parties of varying sizes and vibes organized by individuals. They‚Äôre held in people‚Äôs houses or hotels and are advertised by word of mouth.",Horse Market SF: a whore's paradise,1.0,2.0

Work place bullying is very hard to notice, as it feels as though you are the one in the wrong. That's how bullies work, it's all about you feeling shame. 

Recognising bullying is happening is really really hard. My partner and I both thought I was to blame; it was only when I was lucky enough to see a councilor who explained to me *that it was bullying* that my eyes were opened. The rest of this story, where I get paid, was only because we had a separate HR department with someone who wanted to do the right thing. That was lucky. But even if you can't get paid, it's so important to recognise that you're being gasslit. 

So I started to document the bullying - it was actually really good to do because instead of being stressed 24/7, I'd set half an hour aside after work, document what had happened that day, and then I felt like I could forget about it. 

**Pay off:**

Manager, who worked off site, called me for discipline. I presented them with the documentation. 

A few months later: I get called in to HR to get fired. I present them with the documentation I'd presented my manager, along with documentation about how the manager did nothing, and the documentation about how the bullying continued since then. 

HR didn't know what to do. They told me not to go to work any more, but would continue paying me. 

After six weeks I called them up to ask what was going on. They seemed to have forgotten about me, and offered me a new position, and I explained that I was starting a new job that day. 

Now those 6 weeks were not relaxing, but those 10 pages of documentation ended up being worth about $500 a page, which is pretty validating.",Documenting work place bullying + incompetent management = profit?,2.0,2.0

Leaving this post up in case others find it useful.


So, last 2 days I‚Äôve had some fat shaming comments towards me that I don‚Äôt really appreciate. 
I was in the kitchen making my lunch, just beans on 2 pieces of toast. Nothing huge right? 

This woman from HR comes along (we‚Äôve never gotten on but civil) and says to me yesterday ‚Äòwow, are you feeding a small army‚Äô??

I ignored it and made a throwaway comment of ‚Äòdon‚Äôt be silly‚Äô.

Today, same woman comes along and says ‚Äòoh, you‚Äôre having your weekly shop for lunch again?‚Äô 

And today, I said nothing at all but felt my blood boil. 

She‚Äôs HR and an accountant and been with the company some 30+ years. I‚Äôve been (back) here for 9 months. I had a years work from home on test and trace. Total service is about 2 1/2 years but I know it‚Äôs only the 9 months that count.

The comments are not ‚Äòbanter‚Äô. I‚Äôve never shared any joke or banter with this woman. I detest her but I‚Äôve always been civil. 

So, how do I best combat this?

Semiconductor inventories at manufacturers that need the chips fell to a handful of days last year, and respondents to a recent Department of Commerce survey don‚Äôt see shortages going away in the next six months.

A request for information by the department received more than 150 responses, including ones from almost every major semiconductor producer and from firms in industries that use chips.

The survey found manufacturers that need chips to make products like cars and medical devices had a median semiconductor inventory of five days in 2021, down from 40 days in 2019. It also found that the majority of chip manufacturing facilities are operating at or above 90% capacity, and that the median demand for chips was as much as 17% higher in 2021 than in 2019. The available supply isn‚Äôt increasing enough to match demand.

‚ÄúWith sky-rocketing demand and full utilization of existing manufacturing facilities, it‚Äôs clear the only solution to solve this crisis in the long-term is to rebuild our domestic manufacturing capabilities,‚Äù Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo said in a news release.

The report found bottlenecks in specific semiconductor inputs and applications, including legacy logic chips used in products like cars and medical devices; analog chips used in power management, image sensors, and radio frequency; and optoelectronics chips for sensors and switches. The survey also found bottlenecks in wafer production, which lacks an apparent short-term solution.

Barron‚Äôs highlighted the far-reaching implications of chip shortages in a May 2021 cover story, dubbing the phenomenon ‚ÄúThe Everything Shortage.‚Äù

Raimondo did point to some signs of improvement, including an announcement from Intel (ticker: INTC) that it planned to invest $20 billion to build a vast chip facility in Ohio, as well as a November announcement from Ford Motor (F) and General Motors (GM) concerning automotive semiconductor partnerships. 

Still, Raimondo noted that if a Covid-19 outbreak, a natural disaster, or political instability disrupted a key foreign chip facility for even a few weeks, it could shut down a manufacturing facility in the U.S. In addition, the Commerce Department is looking into reports of unusually high prices for chips sold through brokers.

‚ÄúEvery day we wait is a day we fall further behind,‚Äù Raimondo wrote in a blog post summarizing the survey and urging lawmakers to pass the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act. A vrsion of the proposed law passed in the Senate last year and would include $52 billion in domestic semiconductor funding.",The Chip Shortage Has No End in Sight,2.0,2.0

scw28b,"Mine was at one of my first full time jobs. During college I worked part time at a gas station and when I graduated was offered an assistant manager position which I gladly took to start getting cash asap. The pay was 11 bucks an hour (around 2011) so not great, but I ended up working an overage of 60 hour work weeks so my paychecks were not terrible. I was raised in a small midwestern town by a farming family so was taught that while work is hard it is rewarding, and you should always work your hardest.

I worked every holiday, and every weekend (4am - 2pm to open the gas station, mostly after working until 11pm on Fridays), my PTO was close to 200 hours because I was told if I used it that would negatively impact my chances of becoming a manager from an assistant. I was not lazy, I worked my butt off.  But I was told I could be seen as 'lazy' and not 'dedicated' enough to my job if I used PTO because it could ""Come down to just that between two candidates"" for a manager position. Older and wiser now I understand how stupid I was for falling for that. 

Anyway, after being looked over 4 or 5 times for a manager position for people, and the only explanation of ""You just have to do your time as an assistant, it's how it goes"" I decided to look for other jobs. I had been an assistant about three years at that point and was tired of working every holiday and weekend, and not taking any vacations. My raises yearly at most were .25 cents and my bonus was laughable because I was at a smaller store. I was so stressed my hair actually started to thin and took that as a sign to bail out. 

I found a call center job for close to 20 an hour, applied, and got it. Out of respect for my boss, who I thought I was really close with, I gave a total of a 6 week notice. My new job was to start Jan 5th, so I told my boss I would stay on until the 2nd, that way we could share holidays and I wouldn't ""abandon"" her last minute. Again, I had worked every holiday for this woman for years. I had not gotten to see my family on those days as my home town was hours away so I was missing out on everything. She told me as an assistant manager it was my duty to work all holidays and the managers to get them off. 

To be honest I was pretty upset about it. I was trying to be nice and give extra time to find a replacement, and to stay on so she wouldn't have to work every single holiday. My friend, the manager who trained me at a different store, told me I need to check the handbook because that didn't sound right. Later that week read the handbook for assistants and found that managers and assistants are supposed to ALTERNATE holidays. She had been telling her boss and other managers in the area that I loved working holidays for the pay, and that I volunteered to do so, so she could spend the days with her kids.

When I confronted her with the handbook she told me that she already scheduled me for every holiday (Christmas Eve, Christmas, New Years Eve, and New Years) and would not be adjusting the schedule. That had not even been posted.

 I let her know that if she wouldn't at least work two of those I'd be done early and she told me that wasn't allowed. My official last day with the company was 12/23. I called corporate and explained I had given enough notice and my other job needed me sooner so they cut me a check for my PTO and I never looked back. She ended up having to work all four holidays. 

This was a valuable lesson learned in the worst way possible. Always read the handbook, and know your value as a worker. I did everything for that store, for that manager, and in the end as long as she got the time off she wanted she didn't care about my well being or my personal life.

#### God‚Äôs Word for This Week

At the end of the world, Jesus will come back in glory to judge both the living and the dead. Those who believe in him receive a verdict of ‚Äúnot-guilty.‚Äù ***Those who do not believe stand condemned to the eternal suffering of hell.***

#### Traditional First Lesson ‚Äì Malachi 4:1,2a

What will happen to every ‚Äúevildoer‚Äù on judgment day?

*Every evildoer, i.e.,* ***every sinner, will be punished with the eternal flames of hell****. Eternal condemnation is often pictured in the Bible as fire and burning‚Äîa fitting picture for the eternal torments of hell.*

Those who revere God‚Äôs name will not suffer the punishment mentioned in verse one. Instead, they will receive healing from the ‚Äúsun of righteousness.‚Äù What is that ‚Äúsun of righteousness‚Äù?

*God and his glory are compared with the sun in Isaiah 60:1,19. Jesus is referred to as the ‚Äúrising sun‚Äù from heaven in Luke 1:78,79. This ‚Äúrising sun‚Äù that grants healing is none other than our Savior God.*

#### Supplemental First Lesson ‚Äì Malachi 4:1-3

What will happen to every ‚Äúevildoer‚Äù on judgment day?

***Every evildoer will be punished in fire forever. Eternal separation from God is often pictured in the Bible as fire and burning‚Äîa fitting picture for hell‚Äôs unending torments****.*

sc3j1y,"Here‚Äôs what is abundantly clear, the most important factor driving Kody‚Äôs attraction to his wives is whether he can dominate them. His power and ability to assert his will over his wife had a direct correlation to how attractive he finds them. Let‚Äôs remember a few things:
1. Christine came from polygamist ‚Äúroyalty‚Äù in their world via her grandfather. This gave her a slight edge of importance, a slight power differential from the onset. Kody looks back on their early relationship and recounts having no physical attraction to her.
2. From their first date (according to the Brown‚Äôs book) Kody did not have a physical attraction to Christine.  In fact he described being repulsed by her eating cheesy nachos (such a gentleman). Despite no physical attraction on his part, he slept with her many times, had 6 kids, and at times at least early on had an amicable relationship. This was the period Christine reflected on when she was a ‚Äúok whatever you want honey‚Äù wife. 
3. Trouble began when she was no longer that kind of wife. Kody‚Äôs clear preferential treatment of Robyn and his negligence in Truley‚Äôs near death kidney failure finally put Christine over the edge in keeping ‚Äúsweet‚Äù to preserve his ego and power. She spoke out more. He treated her worse for it.
4. Kody will never again have a full marriage with Meri because her catfish incident told him he doesn‚Äôt have full control over her. Where there‚Äôs no control, there‚Äôs no desire.
5. This season Kody‚Äôs weekly conversations consistently reveal the ‚Äúvalue‚Äù he desires more than anything is unquestioning submission. He praises Robyn for her ‚Äúobedience‚Äù to other wives and grown sons. He told Christine unless she falls in line and becomes a ‚Äúbetter sister wife‚Äù he‚Äôs withholding love.
6. The children he seems to want the least to do with are ones who don‚Äôt follow his rules exactly as prescribed. His love appears conditional on their compliance. 

This man was attracted to polygamy for the power and compliance of all wives and children under him. If there‚Äôs no compliance, there‚Äôs no ‚Äúlove‚Äù from Kody. Did you see any other evidence?",Why Kody has never loved Christine,2.0,2.0

My mother use to smoke w33d while her pregnency
It result that I have a lot of health and mental problems

My mother was always angry, she screams every day.
As a Child I dont understand why but I was conditioned to think its normal.
When I start go to school I was the lonely Child, always crying and hateing other for no reason, hopefully I changed when I met my now best friend Jade.
Because of her I realise that the way my mother treat me was not normal but I didnt do anything abt it. 
When I start going to high school my school result were terrible , I was also victim of bullying bc I was different and Lgbtq.
My mother keep screaming at me bc I was crying after coming home from school (YES she was angry bc I was sad )
One day she started hitting me. She continue for abt 3 years 
One day an ex-girlfriend say to me that it was not normal and I better talk abt it to an adult 
So I did, but nothing happen. She still hitting me everyday for weird reason , bc I cry bc I was ""weird"" bc I was myself.
In 2017 I was diag with depression, I was also having sucidal thoughts but did not talk abt it to anyone. One day we were fighting with my mother (we were just screaming even if she tried to hit me) and suddenly I said to her ""I want to die, to end my life""
I think I will always remember her reactions because it hurt me.
She point at me with her finger 
And start laughing.
Since this day i dont consider her like my mother anymore.
She did a lot of other horrible thing to me 
But this really Hurt me
Since november 2021 I dont live with her anymore.

s8z9ue,"Whenever I use the Internet/social media, especially on sites like youtube/reddit, i notice every now and then an ""incel"" culture. From what i've read, the ""incels"" are a movement of males who blame their lack of sexual activity on inappropriate female standards, or something.

But it seems to me that it extends beyond that. Apparently, the ""incel"" mindset often also has political connotations. They are mostly conservative-minded, and are quite tribalist. And they seem obsessed with some idea of ""masculinity"" that they believe is being targeted by the ""feminist/lgbt agenda"".

It also seems like this is not a US only thing. I sometimes notice hard core Muslim/Hindu males band together online and seem to share similar beliefs.

Does this have to do with some internet movement? I feel like sites like 4chan have become breeding grounds for it, or are responsible for spawning this culture. They also seem to be invested in meme culture, and use a certain jargon frequently, which include ""beta/simp/cuck/based/soy"" etc. They also seem to create a lot of the ""right wing"" youtube videos with exaggerated titles, mostly about ""destroying"" an adversary in a discussion.

As a male who is a little insecure with himself with the belief that he lacks female attention others have, and thus technically fitting of the term ""incel"", it still somewhat surprises me that the lack of a partner has become inter-twined with this somewhat strange, mostly online socio-political movement.

So my question is, when did this internet subculture begin? What spawned it? And have there been studies as to the demographics behind such members in it, and what their motivations are?

Would be curious as to your thoughts. Thanks.","Origin of ""incel"" culture??",2.0,2.0

The Scottish diaspora continues as [at least 5% of those polled here born in Scotland have moved further afield](https://i.imgur.com/8xHti3j.png), including to places like Australia, Canada and the US.

For those of you who believe this sub is dominated by the Old Firm, you would appear to be correct. [When asked what team you support, 62% of you answered either Celtic or Rangers.](https://i.imgur.com/X5naX29.png) The next biggest team was Aberdeen, with Hibs restoring the natural order of being slightly above Hearts.

Some interesting tidbits:

* When Celtic won the league cup there was a surge in polling results from Celtic fans, but when the St Mirren young team took Celtic to a draw three days later, there was a surge in answers from Rangers fans to make it equal between the two again.

* There is no statistically significant difference in opinions on sectarianism in Scotland depending on if you support a team in the central belt/borders versus if you support a team in the north of Scotland; the views are more or less the same

* Sitting at 4%, the r/ScottishFootball unemployment rate is lower than the UK average.

* With 41% of you over the age of 30, the average age of the sub is a good few years older than r/Soccer, [who only have 17%](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/l5csfv/2020_rsoccer_census_results/). With 58% single on there vs 38% on here, if someone on here says that r/Soccer is full of virgin wee guys, I'm actually inclined to believe them.

* The vast majority of Rangers fans said Rangers would win the league, and vice-versa for Celtic. However most neutrals voted Rangers over Celtic, and there were more Celtic fans who voted for Rangers to win the league than Rangers fans voting for Celtic.

The purpose of this Megathread, as if it isn't already known, is to help others find partners or friends to play with, as well as be lewd with. These threads are reset every five to six months. As you are giving out personal information, be sure you don't say anything that could lead you into a bad situation.

**‚ùó‚ùóREMEMBER‚ùó‚ùó:** **There** ***are*** **bad people out there.** 

*Only share personal information with people you know well and think before spending any money on them. We are not held responsible for your naivety...*

To make it short: **Be careful.**

----------------------

You can follow which ever format you wish when it comes to advertising yourself, but it's recommended you follow the format below as it makes your post more appealing to look at, and gives off a better impression. Basically, formatting matters. Nobody wants someone who builds a wall of messy text over a neat organized easy to read posts.

**Edit the format to your liking, include what you like and take out what you do not like.**

*This is a recommended guideline not a rulebook.*

    **Primary Role:** Healer, Healslut, Healbrat, Healdom, Tank, Tanksub, Tankbrat, Tankdom, DPS, DPSsub, DPSbrat, DPSDom, or Switch. This is what you prefer first or what you are the majority of the time.
         
    **Secondary Role:** If any. Healer, Healslut, Healbrat, Healdom, Tank, Tanksub, Tankbrat, Tankdom, DPS, DPSsub, DPSbrat, DPSDom, or Switch. This is what you prefer second or what you are some of the time.
         
    **Sex OR Gender:** What is your biological sex or, alternatively, what is your gender? You can also include preferred pronouns. The more clear you are, the better.
         
    **Sexual Orientation:** Heterosexual, Bisexual, Homosexual, etc.
         
    **Age:** Your real physical age. No rounding up or rounding down.
         
    **Known Languages:** What is your native tongue and what other languages do you speak, if any? This will help people find others that speak languages they're more comfortable with or are looking to learn themselves.

    **Games Played:** Games you happen to play often that you can play with others or feel you could involve other people in.
         
    **System:** Your gaming system, if you happen to use a gaming console or a PC, make sure to let others know.
         
    **Timezone:** Your timezone will let people know of your availability as well as the general idea of where you live without breaching your privacy. 
         
    **Opening Message:**
         
    *This will be your opening message. Be sure to fill this section with as much information as you like, really try to reel people in. Who are you? What do you want? Are you new? Are you experienced? Pet-peeves? Etc. A premade opening message has been created to give a proper example: Hey there! I'm new to this subreddit and concept but i'd love for someone to teach me the ropes. I'd like to hang out with a group of Doms with their subby sluts on the side, maybe get to boasting on which of our sluts' are the best. I play to have fun and would love to have a cute little healer to protect. I have a really nice mic and I'm on quite often, but keep in mind: I'm not really the abusive rough type, so you might wanna look for someone else if that's what you want!*

There's also Discord servers you may join that allows you to find people easily to play with, hang out with, and maybe even get to know a little better. There's varying sizes of users in each server, so pick which one fits best.

###Tools!

**Along with the helpful advice above, there are tools you may use in order to give off a better impression of yourself and what you may want in others. The links below will help you accomplish this.**

* [**BDSM Test**](https://bdsmtest.org/select-mode)

**What is it?**

*BDSM Test is what you would expect: a site for showing your BDSM qualities; what you're into without diving too much into your fetishes. If you are look for a more vague way to show your interests than the other two options below, this would be your go to. It's quite limited and it is a survey, so it's bound to get some things wrong.*

* [**F-List**](https://www.F-List.net/)

**What is it?**

*F-List is a site made by the furry community that functions very well as a place to show off what your fetishes and kinks are as well as what you dislike. It's a great tool with quite the expansive list of fetishes and kinks. Even if you don't share your fetishes, it's good to be organized with them, not to mention it removes the ""Are you okay with X?"" conversations that tend to happen.*

* [**KinkList**](https://cdn.rawgit.com/Goctionni/KinkList/master/v1.0.2.html)

**What is it?**

*Kinklist is a site that allows you to show off what your fetishes and kinks are as well as what you dislike. While F-List is purely restricted to the site, Kinklist exports out to an image that can be shared wherever you like. The drawback is that it's quite lacking in overall fetishes and kinks, however, being open-source, you can fix this by putting the missing kinks and fetishes yourself.*

* [**A Basic Guide to HealSluts and BDSM**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cFEMzqclEaFwyqVCK0WhuNa8BTHcvTlyNqInnnyNnHQ/edit?usp=sharing)

**What is it?**

*This is a guide that should help the newer users into healsluts as a whole. Both figuratively and very literally. It's a must read and will generally help you get a better idea of what to do, how to do it, and what not to do. It's highly recommended you read this before even posting.*

rvnzp3,"Another year.. and another episode of Solana going down.

Today it went down for a few hours in the early morning Asia time, and it took almost 4 hours to bring it back up.

The Solana community blames it on a DDOS attack. Lol

[Solana down. ](https://preview.redd.it/5xnds1jz9m981.jpg?width=1292&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=98c0a705d5bb19abebf46aeabed847a9d26c206a)

As the meme goes, the D in Solana stands for decentralisation.

A network that goes down this often will never be able to attract serious traders.

Imagine you are trading on margin and get liquidated because the network was down.. this happens in centralised exchanges. Solana now natively brings this kind of user experience to the blockchain where you can experience network failure on the chain. What a wonderful innovation.

Blaming it on attackers is just dishonesty. A well designed blockchain is not supposed to have attackers, its supposed to keep producing blocks based on the parameters of the network, not take a break because someone spammed transactions.

Edit: So Sol shills have attacked this post, here is some more ""proof""

Coinbase blocked withdrawals as a result of Solana network going down

[https://status.coinbase.com/incidents/clt85xbsqc1n](https://status.coinbase.com/incidents/clt85xbsqc1n)

status (dot) solana.. LOL at using Solana's own status page to say the network didnt go down. I guess SOL shills love to remain in their centralised fairyland

Edit 2:

Turns out status dot solana page is lying to its own users. If you go into the Solana official groups, you can see dozens of people complaining about failing transactions, missing balances, transactions not being processed etc.

Users are repeatedly questioning the validity of the status dot solana page that shows 100% uptime even when the network was down, and even Coinbase flagged it as down.

This is why you dont use a service's own status page to come to conclusions especially if it masquerades as a decentralised blockchain, but in reality is just a glorified database.

Edit 3: This post is brigaded from the Solana sub. Hundreds of Sol shills are trying to pretend the network wasnt down. Ironically, on Sol sub itself, someone agrees that not only did the network go down, but had to be rebooted too. This is hilarious lol, the network was rebooted but status dot solana shows 100% uptime. Well played, centralised tricksters.

[From Solana's own sub - user there agrees the network went down and had to be rebooted. ](https://preview.redd.it/8437dvtr2o981.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dd2e5e78b307be3a9bf41726d267d1be349c3d54)

TL,dr? Not only did the network go down, as shown by Coinbase status and many complaints on Solana groups, the Solana devs and community managers also tried to suppress whats going on and the Solana status page flat out lies to users.

I would honestly have not bothered going deep into Solana territory, but thanks to the 100 shills who attacked this post, we have all the juicy skeletons coming out of a SOL closet.. what a joke of a database.

Opium has a long history of use as a tool to change behavior of a nation.
In the 1800s the chinese were forced to buy opium from the British and that changed trade power from British selling gold in exchange for silk and other chinese products to British selling opium for silk. 

I don't know the history of Opiates use in America and the population distribution but my impression is that in the past 20-30 years opiates have spread from primarily high population density urban areas to primarily medium population urban, suburban and rural population areas through some mechanism.

One common theory about the mechanism was that doctors started prescribing opiates to suburban/rural areas due to recommendation from Purde Pharma  with oxycontin, but Vicodin and probably codeine predate oxycontin so why was oxycontin the drug of choice?

Get people hooked on prescription pills, cut them off the pills, sell them heroin, offer fent to drug dealers for them to cut with heroin, start killing drug users.

It's not the local drug dealer that wants drug addicts to risk dying from every shot they take. It's someone somewhere above them. Can you imagine being a  drug dealer and finding out a few of your customers died from overdose? Some of them don't care but even drug dealers have favorite customers. Someone wants people dead and fent was designed and released to public for that. 

Before fent with heroin you would spend a lot of money to get high but you could reasonably expect to come back from your high.

After fent, you don't need as much money, but now you're not sure if you're coming back from your high.

sbh53p,"I was walking home from work one day when I was suddenly attacked by the combined forces of 5 different gangs. They had heard about my strong bones and feared my power, and the biggest gangs in my city felt the need to team up to take me down. They came at me from all directions, but I used my strong bone powers to defeat them with my rock hard fists. The ones in the back started shooting at me with their guns, but I used my pinky finger to deflect the bullets and protected my weak vital organs (I've only been drinking milk for the past 20 years so only my bones are strong).  A guy snuck up behind me with a machete and tried to chop my head off, but my neck bones were so strong that it ended up deflecting the blade back towards his weak ribs.

After taking out the cronies I fought the leaders of the 5 gangs. I ran and headbutted the guy closest to me, instantly shattering his skull. I then turned around and proceeded to break the weak bones of 2 of the gang leaders that were trying to sneak up behind me with bone saws. After that I punched one of the remaining gang leaders in the face, and was about to kick the other leader in the pelvis, when it happened. Apparently they had hired an sniper to try and take me out, and I noticed just a little too late. I brought my pinky up to try and deflect the bullet, but because of the angle and the force of the bullet, it ended up making a very small crack my pinky.

Like anytime a queen isn‚Äôt wearing painful shoes they get clocked as lazy, even when the shoes are correct for the look/reference. 

This isn‚Äôt the biggest deal and a lot of shade is coming from the edit but this attitude feels really outdated to me, plus there are people who literally can‚Äôt wear anything higher than kitten heels (remember Jinx‚Äôs partner in the makeover challenge, absolute legend). The first criteria somebody‚Äôs drag is judged by probably shouldn‚Äôt be ‚Äúis it painful enough to wear?‚Äù.",Heels on Drag Race,2.0,2.0

I put a plug in and couldn‚Äôt resist but tease my ass with it and fuck myself with a dildo before I put my toys away to fall asleep. 
And it really was an amazing feeling. It made falling asleep a little harder tho because every time I moved I could feel it move inside me. That made me really wet. At some point i fell asleep tho.

Life doesn't cartoonishly progress through linear stages as you were living in a 1980s coming of age drama.  You are against a 25 year old dating an 18 year old, because they are supposedly in ""different places in life"". So, would you rather a 25 year schooled-at-home virgin old date a 32 year old single parent? I mean, it's most people are not married nor do they have kids at 25. So why is it okay for a 25 year old man with no kids to date some 32 year old single mom, that just came out of turbulent off-and-on relationship? How are these two on the ""same life stage""?

**>Your brain is not fully developed until 25**

Technically not a lie, but a serious case of pseufoscientific junk framing. While neuroscientists agree that the brain continuous developing into your 20s no consensus among neuroscientists exists that would even consider 18 year olds cognitively impaired to the point they couldn't consent. You're literally buying pop-neuroscience and passing it off as undisputed fact when this argument is mostly brought up when it comes to consenting to sexual relations -- if her brains are developed enough to make life altering changes like opening a onlyfans account and doing porn, driving a 4500 lbs Four Wheeler, but sex with older guys is out of limits, you are probably a puritan, a moral hypocrite, or both.

Never allowed to get it again. In my 20's on 2 blood pressure meds now. Why do these things not get acknowledged. Rather they push on to a 4th additional booster as if they are injecting you with normal saline. Everybody needs some baseline antibody protection because everyone will be exposed. This vaccine is good for that introduction as initial exposure for many can also be detrimental without protection. But beyond that, additional doses are straining on your body, I have seen only 1 vaccinated individual in the hospital with covid. I have seen 3 in the hospital related to the covid booster ( 1 with MS, 1 with lupus, and 1 82 year old). But not to be outdone, I've seen countless unvaccinated for covid. Why can't the side effects of vaccination be acknowledged in guidelines like they were for johnson and johnson right before it got the silent boot. This booster is unnecessary for many, not all. You will get covid but you will have the baseline protection to prevent severe illness. In a perfect world everyone will get the initial vaccine dose (yes it is not as safe as it should be but covid does discriminate and those without any prior exposure / vaccination are those that have issues when exposed), but also in a perfect world these vaccines would be safer and I don't think I'm acknowledging any politics in saying so.

I am asking this because my entrance into this topic began when I cheated on my boyfriend and he found out but actually got turned on by it. He was still mad, but after we kissed and made nice he started asking me questions about my cheating escapades on him. They were not simple questions either, he wanted to know all the dirty details and he even got hard and ate me out while I told him about it. He also was the one who ""educated"" me on cuckolding. 

The thing is that I have always been turned on by the idea of cheating on my boyfriend. Sneaking around his back and sleeping with men whenever I get that feeling. Do you think the two lifestyles can co-exist mutually? Do any cuckold men like the idea of just not knowing when their girlfriend is with another man or not? I just like the whole uncertainty of it, like is he just a friend or more?

ryzgqw,"So I've been lurking here for a while, and the othering of women is so bizarre. They're not all in on some conspiracy. They're also not aloof, unattainable celestial beings. Sure, men have more testosterone, which generally makes people bigger, hairier, more assertive and often more violent. But women have testosterone too, and usually have those traits as well to varying degrees.

Women are just men with vaginas, which leads to some fundamental considerations, the main one being that sex is riskier. Vaginas are more likely to contract STDs. They're also a hell of a lot more likely to grow babies. And they're easier to force into sex. This means that while for men, a bad hookup just means you don't tell your friends about it. For women, it could easily mean an STD, a baby, or rape, and the ensuing trauma that comes with it.

Additionally, vaginas are harder to bring to orgasm. This means one night stands are way less fulfilling to women, and long term partners are usually a way better strategy if you're just trying to get off. Most women I know are every bit as horny as men (more so even). They just are less likely to get any relief from their horniness by some mediocre hookup.

If a woman doesn't want to fuck you, it's probably not because she's brainwashed by ""blue haired lesbians"" or cancel culture. It's not because she thinks you're a ""beta cuck"" or whatever other term TRP folks are using nowadays. It's either because she doesn't think you can get her off, or because she's afraid you're going to kill her. And if it's the latter by the way, growing out a neckbeard, carrying an AR15 everywhere and dressing exclusively in camo isn't gonna help.",Women are just men with vaginas,2.0,2.0

Long story short, I've had suspicions. I loaded up my boy when my messages and calls weren't being answered after she got off work. 4 hours, I eventually find out she's driving her friend's vehicle and find it at a hotel. I open the center console and there's a plan b pill. I found out who it was, too. Oh well. Sent her a pic of it asking if she needed it, this is one of the messages I received: ""And I wasn't into black dudes. Until I got a taste of one. And now I love em. ‚ù§Ô∏è""

I'm not mad, I'm just hurt and disappointed. I told my 2 stepsons everything, we cried a lot. The worst way to get a birds and bees talk.The oldest asked why she cheated on me, I don't know, more crying. Told them I may never see them again, more crying. Worst day of my life in the midst of the worst month of my life. I thought this year was going to be so much better.

Edit: I've talked to my stepsons and decided they're still my kids, I'll never abandon them. I'm the only father figure they've ever had and I don't want to live without them.

Edit 2: I expected this to get a little attention (not this much), I expected most people to shit on me for talking to the boys about everything, and that's okay. Maybe it was the wrong decision, maybe it was the right one. What's done is done, I can't take it back and I feel that showing them there is a side of me that is emotional, caring etc has brought us closer together. I'm surprised the things I had said in comments initially ended up bouncing back from being ""unpopular"" opinions. I'll continue to update this as things unfold.

Edit 3. Jan 9 2022: I'm gonna add to the short story. We've had a lot of stressors in our relationship, including my biological who had birth defects and required a lot of hospital visits, 3 surgeries, a rough total of 15+ operations involving anesthesia, 2 life flights, near death experiences, holding him down while nurses fish for veins. He's mostly a healthy and happy boy now. Anyway, we let those stressors get to us and began growing apart. We've been separated for 2 months, I've been doing a lot of self reflecting during my sobriety and have made changes that allow me to be the man I once was again. My wife and I had a long chat where she explained what happened, and I can't say I'm much better than her, but I didn't take it to the point that she did. What she said in messages was purely to get back at me, which is fine. There were a few people hanging out in the hotel room until bed time. She told me that, skipping a lot of shit because it's not entirely relevant and I don't feel like mentioning it, they got to the point where they were going to have sex, he got a condom, came back, and as soon as he started all of the guilt, shame and embarrassment began to set in. She started crying and stopped it. She called her friend, who came and picked her up. When she got home, she sat in the shower for over an hour, telling me she continues to feel disgusting. She absolutely should feel that way. 

I'm not a perfect man, she's not a perfect woman. None of you are perfect, and none of us ever will be. We all make mistakes, and that's what makes us human. What matters is that we learn from those mistakes, reflect, grow and never make those mistakes again. I'll be brutally honest, I don't give a shit what anyone thinks, but I'm not giving up on my wife. I know her, I know her sobbing was genuine, and I know she feels like shit. I gave her an ultimatum she once gave me, ""me or her"", but in this case ""me or him"". I gave her til the end of the day to make her decision, and I'll be seeing her tonight. My next update will be my final one, and I'll be deleting what I thought was going to be a permanent alt account to vent personal issues.

Would like to add, I haven't told her I forgive her. I'm going to take my time doing that so I can mean it 100%.

Commenter reminded me of the pill, which apparently was bought when she came to where I live so we could spend Christmas together as a family.

Sometimes when he wakes up to feed at night, I will set him in bed next to me and hold the bottle while he eats, mostly because I'm still sweating through my clothes some nights and I don't want him to overheat when I hold him. But a couple of times, I've passed out and woken up with him right beside me still. I always put him back in his crib when this happens, but it always comes with really intense feelings of guilt and paranoia. 

Have you experienced this? How do you deal with it?

EDIT: Thanks to everyone who linked helpful resources on safe bed sharing, and those who showed me understanding and compassion. I'm reading all of your resources and i'm going to take the steps to make my bed safe for co-sleeping, and I'm going to talk to my partner about taking shifts.

scajrj,"I fucking hate work. We all do hence this subreddit and I'm sure there are some people out there that enjoy working. I don't understand those people. I hate everything about it. I feel trapped, I feel like I have to pretend to be someone I'm not, I don't feel free, I feel like work dominates the majority of my life and sometimes I feel like just offing myself because the idea of dealing with shitty bosses and managers combined with having to put on a smile and pretend to be someone I'm not and pretend to be happy all the time like a robot 40+ hours a week, every week for the rest of my life with no paid vacations, no benefits, only 3 fucking sick days a year, like who gets a flu and is only sick for 3 days? Wtf! On top of dealing with being degraded while 98% of the profits I make go to my shitty boss or company while I make 2% back and am supposed to be grateful for it makes me just want to not keep living. It's like this horrible dystopia where you have 2 choices. You either play the game, where you're stuck for 8+ hours a day where all you wanna do is run to your car and drive away but you can't because you have to pay your bills and rent + put food on your table while you have no say in anything that happens, while half the time your boss makes you break the law at your expense (working off the clock, not getting paid overtime etc.) and if you get sick all your coworkers will shit talk you and so will your boss but when they're sick or need to miss work they want sympathy because for some reason in US work culture, a lot of workers seem to like to brag about how much they get fucked every day by saying things like ""Well I worked while sick so so can they"" or ""Well I worked off the clock/worked 50+ hours this week so if I can work that many hours then so can you"" and it's all just fucked. No one has any empathy for each other, you almost never get benefits and if you do, half the time you're shamed by your boss or coworkers for using your benefits like paid vacation, I swear I've been in the work for for 14 years now and I am just so fucking sick of it. I hate what work has turned me into.   


When I was a teen and in my early 20s i worked a part time job and just couch surfed and partied and had tons of friends and would go to house parties every day and I had a blast. Then I got to the age where you can't really couch surf anymore and party like that anymore and I used to be such a fun and upbeat person with so many friends that I couldn't even count them all. I was the life of the party if you will. I lived life to the fullest. Fast forward 10 years and now I only lay in bed when I'm not working or doing errands, I have pretty much no friends left, I'm always in a bad mood either anxious, depressed or irritable and all I can even think of on Friday is ""Ugh only 2 days then back to work again"". Work has stripped every ounce of happiness out of me and changed me into a bitter person which is so sad because I used to not be at all. But after being fucked over by coworkers, bullied by coworkers, had bosses that were assholes to bosses that were straight up fucking monsters (I worked for this one job for 5 years and my boss I swear did not have one redeeming quality. He was such a fucking piece of shit. Rich beyond belief yet would skim off our paychecks, broke like every labor law imaginable, he would throw shit at you, cuss you out etc. but I stayed for 5 years because the pay was decent for not having a college degree.) I consider going back to college and working at the same time but I'm so fucking exhausted both mentally and physically from work that the idea of going back to college just feels impossible and on top of that I know lots of people who have degrees and are now in a shitload of student loan debt and they are working at a fast food place or as a waiter or something. I feel like unless you have a doctorates in something that is very useful like a psychiatrist, psychologist, an MD, etc. then you're pretty much stuck doing shit jobs. At least as a psych you could pick your patients and just throw pills at them since that's all they can do and most of the shit hardly works according to the studies but thats the USA right? I feel like everyone is either an alcoholic, a drug addict or mentally ill or shit all of the above. I wonder if it has anything to do with the fact we are practically slaves to our jobs to the point they can even call you on your day off and ask you to come in or ask you questions almost just to remind you that they own you and that we waste our entire lives working when we only have one life. I mean fuck I would do anything to just not have to work yet be able to pay my bills and be able to rent an apartment. I don't need a fancy house or car. I just want to not slave away my whole life for some company that sees me as a number and that drains me so much that even on my time off I feel just defeated.  


Anyone here understand where I'm coming from? TLDR: Work feels like such a waste of life yet we're forced to do it or be homeless and I fucking hate it and it makes me beyond depressed.",Is it just me or does work drain you to the point where even on your days off you just feel depressed and feel like life isn't worth living?,1.0,2.0

s9ool2,"Mars recently announced they were redesigning the M&Ms characters, saying the overall aim for the revamp is ‚Äúan updated tone of voice that is more inclusive, welcoming, and unifying.‚Äù

According to a statement, the changes include the red M&M ‚Äúton[ing] down the bossiness,‚Äù while the green M&M has traded in her much-debated white go-go boots for a set of sneakers and a newfound focus on confidence.  Meanwhile, the orange M&M will ""embrace his true self, worries and all"" in solidarity with the more ""anxious"" Gen Z generation.

To me, this feels more like a publicity stunt, as I have trouble seeing how people can relate to inanimate candies that are designed to be eaten.  But I‚Äôm open to other perspectives-what changing the candies could accomplish, how representation (despite them being candies) could be positive, etc.

Additionally, I don‚Äôt see how investing in a redesign will help as opposed to fighting violence that people face, donating to groups that provide resources for people with anxiety, etc.  Do people really care if there are genders to the M&M mascots, or what to see themselves represented in something they eat?

Things that will change my view:
Evidence that the old M&Ms design is problematic, uninclusive, or promotes violence
Evidence that the redesign will be positive and allow people to feel more included/relate more
Evidence that Mars has dedicated other resources to fostering inclusion, putting their money where their mouth is.",CMV: There is nothing uninclusive or problematic about the previous M&M designs,2.0,2.0

Yeah, that‚Äôs a lot of bull crap I‚Äôm seeing on Twitter, but it‚Äôs kinda real. To be honest, I‚Äôd rather get the payment after I finish my art, update anything in regards to my work, and to let any commissioner know so that I can lessen the chance of fraudulence like this.

Yeah‚Ä¶ along with u/weresdrim, I have become suspicious of Spleeny doing those kinds of schemes. I‚Äôm pretty sure that she is wrong and becoming fraudulent.

I am also sure that if she keeps continuing like this, a lawsuit or a suspension would arrive at her door on the Internet.

I hope she knows about it, but I may have some doubts that she will know. I like her art, but this is just disgusting.

I hope you all have a nice day, by the way!

EDIT 1: This post is only innocent until proven guilty. I‚Äôll apologize when I‚Äôm proven wrong with facts, either from the fans of Spleeny bringing up their story or from u/weresdrim telling his own story about his wrongdoings.

I put it on my clit and turned the vibration all the way up and rubbed hard and fast I could feel my orgasm rising and knew it be intense, I sent a video to my Daddy showing him how fast I was going and how wet I was. I was getting really close to cumming.

1. Two of the party members favour stealth, which means I'm spreading the attacks over two instead of four.
2. This is the Bards first full campaign, and therefore he's new to character creation - which meant he put his +2 into strength rather than dexterity. This does affect AC (see point 3) but also means when he runs out of spell slots, his go to is a sword, not a bow - which leads to more times I'm forced to focus him up close.
3. The main problem - he has 12 AC at level 6, much lower than the other party members. This is due to his light armor prof and +0 dex. I looked through the books to find anything I could drop to the Party discreetly without me ""forcing"" a feat on the character, and the best I could find was a ring of protection - which was snapped up by the ranger. (who now has 18 AC, so never gets hit. She also has 72 hitpoints, and would be perfect for me to direct all the attacks on, if she wasn't also a gloomstalker, and prefers to stealth)  


I want to up the danger in 2022 as we move to the second half of the story, but I really worry the bard is going to drop at some point for good, through no real fault of his own. The player is understandably very attached to his first character, and as the party's healer, his death could lead to them all going.  


I'm not against a TPK, but I'd rather have in game solutions to point out they missed, rather than ""yeah, turns out the bard was built inefficiently in session 1, you were doomed from the start."" As I said, this is the Bards first campaign, and I've never come across this problem before - if there's a feat I can mention to him, or an item I can give that would increase the Bards AC without it being a catch all the ranger will snap up, it'd be much appreciated.

So with all my wisdom I told him ‚Äúit means no one has stuck their dick in it yet‚Äù. From that day on whenever we were around olive oil we had an *inside joke* that explained why it was named that way. Jokes like:

> ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs yet to be fucked‚Äù

> ‚ÄúCompanies are legally bound to disclose if the oil has lost its virginity‚Äù. 

> ‚ÄúIf isn‚Äôt 100% virgin, the FDA will go after them‚Äù

Let me mid-face this with all throughout high-school me and bro had good grades, Bio majors, tech-heads, loved to read novels, comics, etc. People who always seem to know random facts & trivia. Thereby earning the honorary title of ‚Äúfamily geniuses‚Äù (spoiler alert we‚Äôre not) 

Recently through the holidays we had family from all over around.  I was once again back in the kitchen and my mom brought it up. Confidently proclaiming that no man has fucked this olive oil. 

So I smiled, it grew into a giggle, then laughter. My eyes were tearing up, I looked around and I was the only one laughing. Everyone in the kitchen looked at me like I was crazy. They said it was a legal thing that had to be disclosed by companies. I asked ‚Äúdo y‚Äôall actually believe that?‚Äù And they all said yes. 

I asked where they had learned it from or if anyone would do a cursory google search. They said that they learned it from my brother who ‚Äúlearned it‚Äù from me. My family learned this ‚Äúfun fact‚Äù, believed it and went and taught all their friends & extended family‚Ä¶

It‚Äôs no longer just a funny joke but a masterclass on misinformation. (Still funny imo) 

TLDR: Inadvertently convinced family who convinced friends & extended family that an Inside joke between brothers that 100% virgin olive oil meant ‚Äúit was yet to be fucked‚Äù was a real thing.

Edit: 

Yes my family is simple minded but please refrain from  insulting them. (Especially y‚Äôall in my DM‚Äôs calling them ‚Äúfucking stupid‚Äù) They‚Äôre refugees and weren‚Äôt formally educated.

Edit 2:

I didn‚Äôt expect this funny experience to blow up this much on Reddit. Thanks for the awards and the outpouring of support.

The answer is: you are fetish seeking calling us those terms. You are the definition of a chaser. We are women, treat us like you would ANY other woman period. This is not porn, this is real life and we have feelings.

rx8b1v,"1. HR, is not for the employee. It is designed to protect the company from liability
2. Workmen's comp is not for the worker it is to reduce the cost of the employer when an employee is injured.
3. Unemployment is geared for the employer's benefit. Can't let those lazy fuckers suck on the welfare teat too long or they won't want to work.
4. Safety first till it gets in the way of profit or production. Then if someone is injured it becomes their fault or, they are faking it
5. Company loyalty means you are loyal to them and they don't give a damn about you. The closest thing the company comes to feel is a family is their bank account.
6. Right to Work laws mean they have the right to work you to death for a subsistence wage.
7. At will employment means exactly that, You work at the will of the employer.
8. Nepotism is rampant if you are going for a promotion and the person who is in the running is a relative, drinking buddy or someone who is a side piece for the boss, you will lose.
9. The bean counters don't give a damn about you. You are data point on their spreadsheet. If the company wants to maximize profit the first place they head to is employee salary and compensation.
10. A toxic boss is not going to change. He is an asshole and will remain an asshole till they throw dirt on his face. Just fucking leave.
11. If the company starts showing a loss it is never a case of poor management or poor company culture. It is always the lazy workers.

I was raped 8 years ago when I was 19 by a person who I considered a friend. Prior to that I was sexually abused from 7 to around 14 by my male cousin. 

I am struggling to come to terms with the impact that my sexual trauma has had on my sex life.  I've never been able to relax. I've never orgasmed, and the closest to orgasm I have been, it stopped because I was scared.

I had eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) therapy recently which has been a positive experience. I no longer feel anxious when I think about my rape, and I am hoping that going fowards I can have a healthy sex life.

I have realised how traumatised I was, and still am regarding sex. For almost of the sex I have had, I have been dissociating but I haven't realised this until the last few months.

Before getting into my last relationship, I was in my '""slut phase"". I put that in quotes because that is how society would describe it, but I was trying to reclaim ownership over my body by having a lot of one night stands on my terms. I put myself in a lot of dangerous situations and sex was very rarely pleasurable at all. These were not good experiences.

I can't remember if I had had a flashbacks before my last relationship. I had cried during sex but didn't understand why - at the time I did not know what triggers and flashbacks were. 

The first few times I had sex in my long term relationship I had no issues. But when I started to catch proper feelings I started to have flashbacks to my rape that were triggered by sex. Unfortunately for me my main trigger was and is the sensation of vaginal penetration when I am relaxed. I very much associate that physical memory with the moment I gave up/dissociated/became tonically immobilised - I'm not sure what the terminology is for that experience. My memory of that moment is going limp, with pulsing genital's, feeling the sensation of being repeatedly vaginally penetrated and watching what was happening as if I wasn't in my body. That moment - giving up, knowing I could not do anything to change what was happening to me, my body going limp - was the worst bit.  Unfortunately for me that emotional trauma of being raped was intrinsically linked to the physical sensation of penetration. 

I understand now that sex triggered flashbacks of my rape. I understood it at the time, but I could not express what was happening for me. I reacted to my triggers with anger and blamed by partner for them. 

I have never had a sexual experience that wasn't impacted by the sexual abuse I have experienced. I feel broken. I have never had an orgasm and I think it is because I can't relax. Sexual pleasure is not safe for me. I have been working on self pleasure and am getting closer to orgasm, but I am not convinced I will ever get there as every time I do - something stops it.

I want to scream. I want to scream until my voice breaks and cry over how unfair this is. I feel like I will never have a healthy, normal sex life. I was 7, SEVEN. I didn't know what sex was. I am so angery that I will never know what sex is like without a layer of trauma. I am insanely jealous of those who have sex without it being traumatic

I sexually traumatised my ex with my undealt sexual trauma. I realised after we broke up that sex made me feel anxious, and that for almost all of the sex we had I had been dissociating. Prior to my ex, during my ""slut phase"" , apart from a few notable exceptions, I had quite violent aggressive sex because that was and is what I can deal with. My ex is an intense, passionate lover. I want to be able to have that kind of sex.

I don't really have a conclusion or anything. But this is not something that I have seen being discussed and I just want to know I am not alone.

TLDR: I want to cum. I want to relax in sex. My trauma fucked up my relationship. I hope I am not alone.",My biggest issue with my sexual trauma is the on-going impact it has on my sex life - please tell me I'm not alone,2.0,2.0

First of all, I need to preface that I do not live in the UK (although I used to), and nor am I a citizen.  


I have previously made a few orders with the website Sportsdirect, and it was ok for the most part. Everything was delivered in time with no issues whatsoever.  
However, last October I have placed an order, which was not delivered to me.  
There was no attempt on the part of the carrier (Skynet worldwide) to deliver it to me, and any communication attempts on my part went completely ignored.  


By the end of January, I have contacted sportsdirect (again) regarding my order. They have issued a refund, but held back roughly 40% of the total sum as ""delivery charges"".  
So, what happened was:

  
1. They allegedly sent me my parcel 

2. There was no delivery attempt whatsoever

4. There were no communications on their part

4. They charged me for the delivery and the return,

In other words, I just paid money for... nothing.   


It looks and feels like a simple scam. It doesn't seem legal at all.

So I guess my question is: Is there a body I could contact with this? Like, anything other than a courthouse?

r7hffg,"Before we go screaming about ""You're just a dumb survivor who wants to buff DS and ruin the killers"" hear me out- as this is way more Quality of Life than just outright buffing

**A brief history:** The very first ever iteration of DS was without a doubt unfun to deal with as a killer. One with a huge stun with little requirements- which is why I'm guessing a much more difficult skill check than [this crap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X4Pl7_tGRw&t=223s) is used. The second iteration was made more into a ""Anti-tunnel"" perk but little success at that. Not because it didnt prevent tunneling- but it protected people who weren't tunneled and were actively using it as a weapon to progress the game. This lands us where we are now where DS is used purely as anti-tunnel, where progressing the game by any means deactivates it and makes it unusable until hooked again. Throughout this time that skillcheck has remained and for the most part it isn't an issue.

**So the question is again does it need the skillcheck?** And here is why I think it doesn't. The skillcheck was there for when it was more a weapon than a defensive perk- and is the only perk that requires it on the survivor side and gets 2 chances to activate max (Please correct me if I'm wrong on that). Now it is way more in the space of being a defensive anti-tunnel perk. Having that skillcheck isn't a big issue for most players- but is only a detriment to new players and players with poor connection.

My proposal is make it simple and **E**asy. Just making it the active ability button. This will mean that you won't be affected by poor connection with the skillcheck and it will still be effective for new players. Like I said prior, DS is no longer that same offensive perk and this would solidify DS as a forever effective anti-tunnel perk.

Some counter-arguments may be ""But anyone can hit the skillcheck"", ""its their own fault for having poor connection"", ""It adds interaction to the game and skill!"".

* ""It's their own fault"" With how the game is going, its more and more clear that the devs don't want someone's poor connection to affect the game greatly. This is a simple quality of life change like the pallet and dead hard fix- as annoying as both of those can be.
* ""Anyone can hit it"" Well if everyone can, whats the point of it needing to be a skillcheck? Why shouldn't it just be active ability?
* ""It adds interaction"" To be honest, it's as 'interesting' as hook standoffs or the old hatch standoffs. This small interaction doesn't really add much to the game other than frustration if you miss and not much gratification if you hit.

**TL:DR** Should DS use the active ability button instead of skillchecks to make it effective for people that are new/ have poor connection/ use older hardware now that its a pure defensive perk? What's your thoughts on why/why not?

Edit: Changed some wording to try and be more clear

Edit 2: To clarify you only get a small timeframe to use this like with current DS, you cannot wait until you just get to the hook. Thank you u/sirFTF for pointing this out to me!

Edit 3: Along with this, I‚Äôd also welcome some added [parameters](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/r7hffg/should_ds_need_a_skillcheck/hn0ifhc/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3) where it deactivates when someone else is hooked or you‚Äôre the last one remaining",Should DS need a skillcheck?,2.0,2.0

‚Ä¢ As long as they haven't been WWF/WWE/WWE World/WCW/IWGP World champion and you can argue that there's a little bit of cringe, they're in.

‚Ä¢ This means ECW, TNA, ROH, ICW and the other world titles don't disqualify you. Most wrestlers probably can be boys! NWA is eligible as long as the company wasn't affiliated with WCW at the time (so eg Dusty = nope, R-Truth = fine, Magnus = fine)

‚Ä¢ **\*\*ALL WOMEN are eligible\*\*\*:** BUT if you have a prominent female (Becky, Asuka, Charlotte etc) you'll have to take them during one of their crap gimmicks (eg Leprechaun Becky) Did you know? Female boys are called Cail√≠ns! (Call-eens)

‚Ä¢ **\*\*GIMMICKS are also eligible\*\***, for a wrestler who has gone on to lose their boydom; eg Jamaican Me Crazy Kofi = Yes, WWE Champion Kofi = No.

‚Ä¢ **Past champions WHO ARE ELIGIBLE:** \[As per Episode 73\]([https://youtu.be/g97lX2iEOcc?t=6m43s](https://youtu.be/g97lX2iEOcc?t=6m43s)), Dolph Ziggler, Great Khali, Jack Swagger and Jinder Mahal (we're giving them a pass considering the quality of their run and career since) as well as Finlay, Christian and Regal (we fought V1 over this, but he had none of it, so they're allowed)

‚Ä¢ Non-Champions who aren't eligible: Earthquake (he was actually great), Piper, DiBiase, Owen, Garvin, Jake, Perfect, Razor. That kind of zero-cringe main event in a territory

‚Ä¢ Tag-teams count as ONE slot, provided they both meet the above requirements. ie no Cena & Batista tag teams!

‚Ä¢ Your bottom boy is your #1 boy! I'd LOVE you to put in why your bottom boy got to be at the top!

**\*\*OUR BOYS:\*\***

Jay: Bottom Boy TEST, Steve Blackman, Heidenreich, Too Sexy Brian Christopher, Sherri, B2 Bull Buchanan

V1: Bottom Boy MATT HARDY, Christian, Chavo, Funlee, Regal, Mike Knox

OOC: Bottom Boy VIRGIL, Marty, Carlito, Albert, Thurman Sparky Plugg, Shane Sewell

Hi everyone! As we conclude a historic year filled with drama and achievement, we can look back with pride and say we were the best club in the world. Many may argue that, but the fact remains - the Kings of Europe are back (in blue).

In our time of retrospect, it‚Äôs also crucial to consider what helped mold our community to what it is today. There were unforgettable posts, insightful comments, and some rowdy members that we can give thanks and show our appreciation to through the Best Of awards.

We invite everyone to nominate users or links below under each category *by Saturday 8 January*. You can nominate yourself and there are no limits to the number of nominations, but please write a sentence or two about your reasoning. **The top two users of each category will win a month of Reddit Gold, as well as custom flair to highlight their contributions!** The categories are:

-	Best Serious Commenter - you can always expect level-headed discussion from them.

-	Best Meme - first one out the gate on Tuesdays.

-	Best Prediction - our very own Nostradamus.

-	Best Contributor - high quality OC or consistent effort put into the community.

-	Best Post - it may or may not be the highest voted or most commented on, but it was the best post of 2020.

-	Funniest Post or Comment - a truly hilarious moment in time.

-	Best Comment - the greatest comment this year has seen (votes and awards do not need to be the barometer here).

-	Community Choice Award - for anything and anyone that doesn‚Äôt fit the above. The ‚ÄòAbove and Beyond‚Äô stand-out individual.

Please reply to the categories below with your nominations and vote on your favourites. I‚Äôll be putting on contest mode to hide the scores. On behalf of the mod team, happy holidays and a happy New Year!

rxj62y,[deleted],What would u do differently if u knew nobody would judge u?,,
sfsvye,"To be a little more specific, I've been looking a lot at Bournemouth. 

I live in Canada currently, and the housing market is nowhere near survivable. I've been looking at some apartments, mostly 3 bedroom ones since I'm moving in with some friends, and the prices look decent when compared to minimum wage for people our age ( I've been told that minimum wage in the UK is crap, which you may think, but do remember I'm comparing this to minimum wage where I live, which is even crappier ).

For transportation, we mostly plan on walking, since the city we live in has terrible public transportation and we're used to walking anyways. We don't plan on getting a car.

There's going to be six of us, one of us as a little house-husband person, so 5 of us working at max potential. We've mostly calculated with only two of us working, just in case, and praying on savings in worst case scenario. 

We've looked at food prices, as well as learning the cheapest recipes. We think we're set, but I'd love to know if we're wrong.

We've accounted for utilities, which is kind of why there's six of us moving in together.

&#x200B;

Anything else I might want to take into account? Your personal opinions on if we should? Maybe what Bournemouth is like if you happen to live there?

ru47pr,,DO YOU KNOW WHAT A MICROWAVE DOES TO NUTRIENTS. Chef gets scientific about covid nutrition.,,
s7bvc5,[removed],I made my little sister into my own personal slut,,
sdnqg0,"When I started my most recent denial journey, I set a mini goal for myself: If I could fuck my ass with my biggest dildo (a bad dragon knockoff- small by their standards but huge to me), I could have an orgasm. My biggest desire is to become the perfect anal slut for one day, so there's no reason I shouldn't be preparing. Being a slut on reddit has already pushed me so far, and I only want to go further. 

For months I've been edging with anal only. I've been working myself up from plugs to dildos, and finally to the monster. Something changed tonight- I needed an orgasm so badly. I worked my way up to my largest plug before deciding I couldn't wait any longer. I didnt stop pushing the dildo in me until I made it to the base. I screamed in pain and bliss, but knew in that moment I didnt want to cum, i just wanted to be stretched more than I've ever been. I stayed like that for a while, my ass full and stretched. I fucked it slow and deep, reaching the edge of the deepest orgasm before stopping. My clit throbbed and my pussy ached, but I know I did the right thing. Perhaps I really do require permission to cum. Ironically, I can now fuck my ass with this toy, but my pussy is too tight. I'd like to stay this way.

So now I'm sat here, my largest plug filling my ass comfortably, so I know I need to buy a bigger one. I desperately want some tasks to continue my edging and stretching, especially challenges and games I can play over time. I accomplished my big goal, now I need something bigger. I'd like reddit to decide how my ass is treated until I might be able to earn an orgasm. I would also love it if you would send me big dildos and toys for me to buy and stretch my ass on, or porn for me to edge to. 

Reading comments in much more of a turn on for me, but of course you can DM me if that's your preference. 

Kinks: edging, orgasm denial, anal, mind control, slut training, humiliation, punishment, exhibitionism, wasting money on sex toys 

Toys: plugs (S, M, L, long and ribbed, S tail, M tail, M jewel, beaded vibrating), dildos (6"", 8"", double ended, S ribbed & M thick bad dragon, 8"" with rabbit, glass ribbed), vibrators (rabbit, hitachi, 1 wireless wand) 

""Bondage gear"": Pegs, nipple clamps, nipple clamps with chain, rope, collar, cuffs, leash, handcuffs, rope, blindfold, hood with mouth opening, ball gag, and a low impact flogger. 

Limits: scat, blood, vomit, beastiality, sharing pics, anything involving people I know","I (F23) earned my orgasm, but turned it down.",1.0,2.0

The closest AMC theater is 1.5hrs away in another state. That pissed me off and made me start looking for other jobs. I genuinely cared about my job and the account, so I waited to accept a job offer until I had trained someone else to do my job. When the time came, I met him in his office and told him that I had accepted another job and that I was putting in my notice, but to not worry because I have someone already trained. When I told him that I had accepted a position with another company in our field but would not be doing the same thing so it wouldn‚Äôt violate my non-compete, he called our chief legal office on speaker phone while I sat there. The CLO tells me that ‚ÄúI cannot even mop floors at a company in our field for at least a year‚Äù. The CLO adds HR to the call and HR tells me that since I won‚Äôt be pursuing my new job, they are going to let me work 2 more weeks to make sure the handoff goes smoothly and then I will be fired for looking for other jobs. 

They asked me for more details as to what I would be doing at my new job, and I told them I wasn‚Äôt going to discuss it. After I left, the CLO of this company (a company who brings in $6 BILLION/year in revenue) called me randomly for the next few weeks trying to intimidate me. They even started contacting my new employer. Luckily, I don‚Äôt work for a shitty company now and the CEO got involved and told them that they would be ready to fight this in court. They stopped contacting me after that, which meant they never even planed in taking me to court. They just wanted to scare me into quitting my new job. 

Fuck companies like this. We don‚Äôt have to put up with this shit anymore

Company is Total Quality Logistics.

Edit: this was 3 years ago. I‚Äôm with the same company that I left my previous job for, and they have given me the budget to start a division of the company that directly competes with my previous employer ü§ó I still have that AMC gift card too.

I‚Äôll go ahead and address some of the questions I keep getting asked:

Why did you stay if you were so underpaid for your performance? Because I was fresh out of college and dumb. 

Why did you tell them where you were going? Because I was fresh out of college and dumb. 

Why did you even give them a two week notice, why didnt you walk out? Because the people who I actually cared about at that job would be the ones who felt the effects of that more than my manager.","I made my boss over $1.5 million in commission over two years, while I made $45k/year.

sc826v,"A friend of mine is Japanese, she's been living and studying in Ireland for about three years. She mentioned yesterday that she hadn't been in the city centre for about two years, because she gets too many racist comments. 

Since March 2020, she said that people have regularly said angry things about COVID and told her to go back to China. It's mainly teenage gangs (unsurprisingly), but she says she's also had several comments from old women, and one from a young Irish shop owner that told her not to come in. 

She said this all quite matter of factly, and said that all Asian people are experiencing it. She's slightly confused about the references to China, because she's Japanese, not Chinese - but it seems they just refer to all east Asians as Chinese. Anyway, as a result of all this, she doesn't go to the city centre, she doesn't leave home in the evenings, and she has started taking taxis instead of buses.

I felt like shit when I heard it. I want Ireland to be a welcoming place for foreigners. We Irish have a long history of emigration, and faced prejudice of our own, notably in the UK.

Just because someone is from Asia, it doesn't mean they have anything to do with COVID. If you feel tempted to make comments to an Asian person, please don't. And if you see it in public, please call it out (unless gangs of scrotes obviously, the law doesn't apply to them).",Anti-Asian racism in Dublin,2.0,2.0

sff2ws,"Nowadays its very common to see redditors criticizing PUA's. Apparently PUA's are exploiting women and taking advantage of them. And just the term itself now has become so controversial, that it brings out the worst in people.

I could not disagree more. To suggest they are "" exploiting "" is to suggest that what they're doing is akin to hyponsis, intoxication and deception?

To me it just sounds like they're trying to improve their social skills and flirting skills, so they can connect better with people. And to do that you need to practice.......and what better way to practice than talking to numerous people?

Anyways, the main point of my post is that for some reason this behavior is seen as toxic now. Whereas years ago......nobody gave a crap. Even Tony Robinson would frequently cite PUA's and talk well of them.

I wonder why this is? Is PUA-ing really toxic? I don't like the direction in which this world is headed. Discouraging men from developing their social skills, and then wondering why there's a male mental health epidemic.

sehcfj,"I met a pot SB yesterday. New to the bowl (4 days in).  Had a great visit. I thought we worked out an agreement and tentatively planned a next (intimate) date for two days hence.

Today I texted her to say good morning. Said what a great time I had, how I was looking forward to next time. No reply. 

This afternoon I messaged and said how I was sensing some hesitation. I offered another platonic date so she‚Äôd be more comfortable. 

She said ok, but she‚Äôd need to be paid!  Turns out her ‚Äúfriend‚Äù told her the way things work is that she gets xxx/2 for eating, then xxx after relationship turns sexual. 

I think I set her straight. Sent her a link to this forum‚Äôs definition of rinsing. 

I wasn‚Äôt sure if she was a rinser or just naive. But I did like her. So I offered another platonic date, ‚Äúno money changing hands (unless I offer a gift as I did yesterday).‚Äù

She agreed. We went to dinner. Had a great time. 

Then at the end, she kind of implied that she was expecting her xxx/2 payment.  I set her straight about what we had discussed. We parted on less pleasant terms than I would have liked. 

So my question(s): 

1) what obligation do SDs typically bear to teach SBs how things work?

2) for SBs: how did you learn how things work?

3) next her and write it off as sunk cost?",Do SDs need to educate newbie SBs?,2.0,2.0

s5ama7,"I'm not into Heather McDonald's podcast usually but I heard Lala was on it so gave it a listen. She gave some new tea about the stuff with Randall and I think it's the most she's said so far. I'll do a quick recap;

-They discuss cosmetic surgeries and injectables and talk going overboard. Lala said she thought season 8 was best look as she was freshly injected with botox and filler. She said she's gotten cheeks, lips, forehead and under eyes done. She saud she hasn't gotten anything done since before she got pregnant. 

-They talk about Jamie Lynn Spears new book and the Britney Spear conservativeship.

-Lala mentions she hasn't been watching weekly because Randall is on the show. She mentions that the show pays for food and 2 alcoholic drinks per person when they go out and pays for flights and hotels for trips. She said Raquel and James probably got a discount for the engagement party but that the show doesn't cover the rest for parties so they paid out of pocket.

-They briefly mention the Randall investing in Katie and Ariana's sandwich shop story. Lala said Randall only invested $25,000 and got the rest of the $250,000 investment from an ""actual wealthy person"" who, happens to be Katie's friend (and she wasn't happy about it). That's how he cuts deals. She kinda laughs it off but I assume she always knew this? 

-Lala says their dynamic wasn't real. She thinks Randall put on a show and explains why she can't watch the show (basically he disgusts her).

-Heather brings up the Randall situation (a little background info, Heather and her husband were friends with Randall and Lala) and Lala said Katie was the one to tell her about the Nashville trip. There's a lot of info here so I may not have all the details. Katie calls Lala and says she saw photos of Randall with the 2 women. Lala had spoken to him earlier that and he said he hadn't gone out that night. She knew by the photos he had lied. Then he let slip he met them at a penthouse party. She said a few days before he refused to show her his room in another hotel on facetime and was in the hotel hallway with no shirt on üò≥. She was annoyed and suspicious and said they needed couples therapy and accused her of freaking out for no reason. 

-She said when the photos of Nashville came out someone (she doesn't say the name...I think it's Jax) came to her and said when Lala first got sober Randall told them Lala used to be fun, kinky and sexual before she got sober. Lala said Randall told her he'd leave her if she ever drank again and said it broke her heart (and I believe her) to hear what he said behind her back. 

-Heather brings up the wedding getting postponed several times due to covid. Lala said once she had her baby she lost interest in getting married. She said before she was born things were okay but he changed after having the baby (just like with his ex) so wasn't into getting married.

-Heather refers to Lala's comment on WWHL ""Who would sneak around with Randall?"" and talks about women falling into a trap of ""dating down"" and thinking the other person isn't going to cheat because they are less attractive. She mentions Randall subtly and how being on the show made him more ""desirable"" because if Lala was with him, other women would be with. 

-Heather brings up the Jeff Lewis Flipping Out episode and Randall owing him money and Lala says she wasn't aware of that but said ""get in line"".

-Lala says nobody knew about James and Raquel breaking up until the reunion. Tuesdays episode is the finale and the reunion is the week after. 

-Lala said only a few times in her 3 year sobriety journey has she craved a drink. She said the last time was in Puerto Rico when Randall was making a movie. 

-Lala said she told the group to pick a side after the breakup and that as far as she knows nobody talks to him. 

-Lala said she had a crush on Fofty in Junior High. She said Fofty can ""bring the dogs out"" regarding Randall and she won't be rushing to defend him this time.

I grew up around the corner from a guy called Dessie. In an area of Dublin filled with scrotes and scumbags, he was one of the worst. He was always causing problems, attacking people, breaking and entering - all the usual scumbag behaviour. I lived in fear of him.

&#x200B;

In 1989, when he was 19, Dessie and his scumbag friend forced their way into the flat of a 35-year old woman in the middle of the night. They beat up her boyfriend and bound and gagged him. Then they spent 6 hours taking turns raping her, beating her, holding a knife to her throat and threatening to cut off her boyfriend's fingers. As if that wasn't enough, four days later, Dessie and the same friend broke into the flat of a 19-year old girl and spent 5 hours taking turns raping her. They threatened to slit her throat ""from ear to ear"".

&#x200B;

He was sentenced to 10 years for the first rape and 12 years for the second, to run concurrently of course (because judges loved to give concurrent sentences -  whether you raped 1 person or 100 - it was always concurrent!). He got out of jail around 2000 and devoted the rest of his life to the drink. He just died a few weeks ago, in his early 50s.

s1ixaf,"Thought I'd provide a general summary on Q on his recent podcast: ""Tell Em Steve-Dave (podcast about sports, current events, and more). Was a really interesting segment about halfway through the most recent episode #505 (Anklez and Tipz).

I'll try to provide as direct as a quote as possible, but sometimes in the course of talking/conversation, things get jumbled, but this is the gist. I preface this by saying **listen for yourselves** to get the most accurate context to what he was saying and to get the words straight from his mouth. Again, I'm presenting them as quotes here, but it's very difficult to one-to-one match everything, exactly as it was said, given the nature of his speaking pattern and host interruptions.

**FINDING OUT JOE WAS LEAVING**

""Look, the only thing I'll say, that's new information, is, like, I was fucking shocked when I found out, too. You know what I mean? I didn't necessarily see that coming. But, you know, he's ... he's a friend and I'm not going to talk about his personal life, which is clearly where he's gone to dwell now. So, it is what it is.""

He later went on to say ...

""I don't even know what happened, and I'm in the middle of it"" and that he even doesn't ""understand the whole thing.""

**WONDERING ABOUT SHOW'S IMMEDIATE IMPACT & DECIDING TO KEEP GOING**

""I''m happy to talk about the show, umm ... which is, we're back to work, and we're finding ... you know, look man, it's fucking, we initially we didn't even know ... is this even worth doing without Joe, but you just look at it, and you're like, yeah, I want to keep doing it.  ... I mean, if I left the show, I wouldn't want the guys to stop just because I left type thing.""

""... And now, and look, fuck man, there's so many negatives to Joe not being there. We're losing a comedic powerhouse and stuff, but there's nothing we can do I guess than just, accept that it is what it is, and give ourselves persmission to have fun. And once I got through that feeling, it's been a fucking blast. It's almost a new show now.""

Q also mentioned that Joe was so instrumental behind the scenes, and people are stepping in to fill in the gaps as best they can.

**HOW THE SHOW WILL CHANGE NOW & HOW THAT MIGHT BE A HEALTHY THING**

Q acknowledge why the show as successful, saying that the four of them complimented each other's parts well, hiding each other's weaknesses and playing to strengths.

With Joe gone now, there is an opportunity to break from some conventions, though.

""This show is going to be a bit ... weirder now. I can get more of my shit now."" (Q said this in a laughing tone, with some self-awareness that he likes weirder humor, it seems).

While not giving any specific examples or saying if anything would seem drastic, Q seemed reinvigorated by the possibilities and revamp of formulas.

""But I am getting in some fun, weird shit now. It's kinda revitalized the show. I think this is actually going to give the show legs that were getting tired, if that makes sense.""

""I was in a 2-hour meeting about the opening credits the other day (noting he's never given a shit about this ever before).""

""We're thoughtfully rethinking the entire show.""

Some of these changes were things he/the group  ""always wanted to do"" but became locked into the format and expectations of the show, since everything became so formulaic and successful.

""Things just didn't fit on Impractical Jokers and the format, but, now, I'm like ... fuck it!""

**FAN REACTION TO POSSIBLE CHANGES**""The biggest change has already happened, so we can make little adjustments to the actual format.""

Of important note regarding the new and ""weird"" things coming, Q says:

""I wouldn't do it if I didn't think people would like it.""

**HOW LONG SHOW WILL CONTINUE**

Q noted they will start shooting this month. They have 9 episodes left for season 9, and 17 or 18 to do for season 10.

The would be ""shooting the rest of the year"" to make this content, Q said.

In his ""heart of hearts,"" he doesn't feel like season 10 will be the final year.

However, he does acknowledge the unknown ahead, with Joe gone, fan reaction and new format stuff that may or may not prove successful.

If this is the final seasons ahead, he's glad they're going all out and trying to innovate a bit:

""Let's go balls to the wall. Let's just fucking go for it (if this is the last seasons), and if it doesn't work out ... at least I went out doing shit that I fucking wanted.""

**FEELING EXCITED FOR THE FUTURE**

Q stressed that he was only talking about it from the angle of trying to make the most of the situation he's currently in ... but, that said ...

""I'm more vested, and more involved, and having more fun than I have in a long time, so it's good. From that angle.""""It's going to be everything people love, minus something, plus more.""","Q on his recent ""Tell Em Steve-Dave"" Podcast recap: Talks about Joe leaving, future direction of show, on if he thinks the show will end at season 10, and things about to get ""weird""",2.0,2.0

I feel confident posting this here because I feel like it'll be the least likely to get toxic of any sort. What Jae did was completely not okay and out of line, but he gets that. I see so many people dragging him endlessly everywhere I go and it's overwhelming, for even me. While I'm somewhat conflicted on how I feel fully, one thing that annoys me is people getting pressed over the ""insincerity"" of his apologies. He apologized to Jamie on twitter, saying it straight out, and people are criticizing him for not apologizing enough, but they get just as mad when someone tries to apologize more because it's ""too much"". To me his apology was a very reasonable way to phrase it, written, I'm sure, with a very large amount of worry and guilt. The second one is his apology later live on twitch. People have criticized it for its lack of substance in sorts. essentially he just says ""I really fucked up"" a couple time and then ends stream, very visibly disheveled. I've never fucked up on this level, but I absolutely know the feeling of offending someone strongly and regretting it like he clearly is, and my inner monologue is almost identical to what he said and did on stream apologizing. I  don't get panic attacks or have anxiety but I have some level of an idea of what they are like and what can cause them. In situations like this, just the self judgement and knowing how the other person feels is bad enough, I can't imagine going on twitter and seeing thousands of people judging and criticizing your decisions, especially with Jae's mental and emotional state. So while I'm not defending what he did, I wish people would back off on calling him out on it. At this point I'm sure he very much understands what he did, he doesn't need more people telling him. As for Jae himself, I think his behavior on stream could've been much better gone about, it's his fault he said those things, but I don't think he's completely to blame. I can imagine the freedom he must have felt from returning to streaming and leaving JYPE and he got carried away and egged on by the chat's incel-type energy he gathered from his time associating with OTV and friends in the past (that's not a jab at the ccs themselves they just have some very vocal unsavory viewers, not their fault) and he said some stuff he regrets. I think it'd be best for Jae to take a good break from the internet and have a good talk with Jamie, sort out things and hopefully return a better man. As I said before, I'm trying to stay impartial in this but I really like Jae and want to see his career thrive, and I don't think that can happen until he takes some time to himself.

Assuming this all goes well, I also have another thing. Jae said on stream discussing his situation with JYPE and Day6 that he believes Day6 will be together as 5 again in the future, which would appear difficult considering his current lack of membership in the group. With Day6's contract expiring this year my theory is they may pull a Got7 and leave the agency as a group, they definitely have the self-sufficiency to pull it off and I think it could really let their creativity flow. If you read this long, I hope you have a great rest of your day or next day if it's night, thank you MyDays :)

I'm proud of Amy for this tactic. It forces Tammy to admit that it's not an emergency and makes her aware that everyone knows she's making it up to try to get her way.

Only then we become anal-whores, until we satisfy enough clients(girls who hereby learn to come by anal only may be excused the first time, after that, they have to be trained to say stop).
Then we are edged regularly with audience to make sure we learn to say stop in time. We learn to edge each other with mouth, fingers and toys, and learn to read each others bodies closely. And if we fail and come or let another girl come, we fall back to entry level mouth-sluts. 
Only after we mastered edging without coming by someone elses stimulation, we may be cunt fucked by customers. They rely on us to hold back our own orgasms, we need to be able to do so safely, even if they want to fuck us stupid. We will be drooling messes by then that will eagerly pleasure any person and make them feel like the sexiest and best lovers ever. We will crave their pleasure and be slippery and welcoming. 

Customers can purchase (or auction or win in a raffle?) the right to make a girl come, but it will be expensive. The girl will be expected to plead with the customer to not make her come, since she will loose all her value and fall back to beeing a mouth-slut after that. The customer can play with her make her do all kinds of things to ""appease"" them, put it will be their choice to decide that. 
If a girl comes unallowed, ""stealthily"", she gets a few days of orgsam torture and beeing the cheapest slut to fuck in the brothel, by that time she begs to be denied again. 

Beeing the first to fuck a girl who had no penetration for weeks and months will be another special treat. 

Girls may also earn their right to orgasm without dropping back down the hierachy by having served a certain number of customers, or by other good girl deeds like serving as painsluts to BDSM clientel, human furniture, and such. 

The two longest denied girls will have a contest, maybe of witts, of sucking cock (who can milk four guys first), of holding still while beeing vibed, of any cruel nature the customers and other girls can imagine. The winner will get a small number of ""free"" orgasms, the looser will get orgsam tortured and sold cheaply like the slut she is. This way, all the girls sooner or later start all on the bottom again. 

** 

Hope you enoyed reading my little fantasy as I did writing it. I did it with my hitatchi pressed to my clit. I'm on day 13 of denial with daily edging, and I'm soaking wet now. I hope my master will use me this weekend, wish me luck.

To make a long story short, i was at a nye party last night with my coworkers and didnt even know this guy was bi. We were all drinking, having a wonderful time and he brought his gf with him. Instead of smoking in the house, we went to the car downstairs. It was really cold outside so no one was going to come to the car anyways..

We were in the car smoking and talking and i just noticed his dick was getting hard af while we were smoking and i said, you must be thinking about your gf with that bulge. He looked down and we just started laughing. I said lucky girl to taste all of that and he just laughed it off. We continued smoking then he said hey.. before we go back in, you want to taste it? Wow i was so surprised he asked that. I said you not ready for that, youll be addicted. He said show me‚Ä¶

He pulled it out and it was about 7 inches uncut. I put my head in his lap and went to town, i put it all the way down my throat and let him fuck my mouth, he was in love with how deep i can take it. While he was fucking  my mouth, he was getting close saying im bout to cum, your going to make me cum. I felt him trying to pull out of my mouth and cum so i deepthroated him and he came right down my throat. I swallowed all of it, he never had anyone do that before. He saw me this morning and could tell he‚Äôs been thinking about it all night. He watches me while i move around the room. I told him whenever you need it, hmu.

sdypqy,"I'm scripted 20mg diazepam for a future taper but grandma just landed today and I snatched some clonazepam (my love) and nitrazepam. I took 1mg of clonazepam and around 20mg nitrazepam on top of my diazepam dose and it's my GF's birthday. Our relationship is quite toxic, she has mental episodes but blames all our failures on my poly drug addictions. 

I asked her how to cook her fave pasta and if she eants smth to drink (she's at work) and she replied smth like ""I don't know, do what u want"". This triggers me hard as fuck, this morning I woke up and wanted to kiss her for just 2 mins but she was in too much of a rush despite having 1 hour left.

I barely feel the benzos I took, almost zero respiratory deppression, no classic benzo effects. Actually, quite the opposite. This makes me suffer and to look for her validation.

When I'm out of benzos and start withdrawing I couldn't give 2 fucks about whatever she says or if she has a shitty attitude. This attitude always comes on now am then and I can barely talk anything to her yet our relationship fails because I'm an addict and she purely can't understand addiction despite me explaining everything top to bottom last night while she was ""listening"", not looking at me and scrolling on tiktok and eventually saying ""it's a choice, i don't get it"". 

Bottom line is, high doses of benzos make me needy as fuck and instead of getting the normal effects I'm filled with paradoxical effects like I took a bad stim or some shit.

s3wiav,"As a long time JRE listener I was actually pretty upset when Rogan moved to Spotify.  I already had a Spotify account but I used it exclusively for music and I didn't like their podcast app (it's still not great).  I also enjoyed seeing the comments on YouTube and was worried it would be missed when he left the platform.

But what I hadn't anticipated was how much censorship on big tech was increasing.  Ten years ago YouTube/Facebook/Twitter and the like would remove nothing unless it was explicitly illegal, over time they started censoring more and more.

The censorship in big tech has really accelerated the last couple years in response to Trump being elected, BLM, Jan 6 and covid... I can't ever remember a JRE episode being removed from YouTube as soon as it was uploaded and in the last couple years we've seen the Bret Weinstein pod, Robert Malone pod as well as multiple others be removed from YouTube immediately.

There has been a big push to censor Rogan in particular with [multiple articles](https://www.reddit.com/r/JoeRogan/comments/s2ewcn/hundreds_of_doctors_sign_open_letter_against/) in the mainstream press pushing for it in just the last 48 hours.

I have very little doubt that if Rogan hadn't made the Spotify move the episodes I mentioned would have been taken down from all relevant platforms making them very hard to listen to.

The JRE exclusive was a huge deal for Spotify, he is their largest podcast by far and they have a big incentive not to take him down.  If that deal hadn't taken place I don't think those episodes would be readily available.

That is why I am very thankful the deal went through so there is always somewhere I can listen to the episodes.

I should caveat that I actually disagree with a lot of Rogan's take on covid.  I personally am double vaccinated and boosted as is my wife (we haven't decided what to do with our kids yet).  But I don't think censorship is the answer and I'm glad Rogan has a platform to speak to whoever he wants to without being censored.",Why I'm glad Joe Rogan moved to Spotify,2.0,2.0

Yes, we have an extremely bad offensive line. No, not every QB in the league would struggle that badly in a game like that. Was he set up for success? No, of course not. But it's insane how many hoops you Tua stans jump through to justify a performance like that

He literally has RPO options and decides to hold onto to the ball, but that somehow becomes the coaches fault for not running the ball. He misses throws and literally lets the ball slip out of his hand for a fumble, but that's somehow everyone BUT Tua's fault.

It was a bad game that would shake anyone's confidence in a young QB. That doesn't mean we should trade him. But don't lie to yourself and pretend Tua himself had nothing to do with it. It's embarrassing",This sub has become a Tua apologist forum. It's okay to admit he had a bad game,2.0,2.0

Went to a cashier‚Äôs till which I haven‚Äôt done in years, paid, was chatting to the lady and I was just putting my change back in my purse when the customer who was waiting behind me came up close and starting sighing and swearing under her breath that I was taking to long. I distinctly heard her call me a ‚Äòstupid p@ki‚Äô. 

Turned around and said ‚Äòexcuse me?‚Äô She verbally abused me loudly, no one stepped in and she had a go at me for taking too long because I was ‚Äòfiddling with my purse‚Äô and her ‚Äòkids were waiting‚Äô. 

I asked her why she was being so rude, and that her kids were probably embaressed of her. Told her manners don‚Äôt cost a penny. 

Anyway I had to take the moral lowground (as we all do ocassionally). I parked my car up by the entrance and waited for her to come out. I shouted ‚ÄòOi! Learn some manners you bitch!‚Äô And sped away. 

Was kinda shaken up though, especially by the racial abuse and the fact that the cashier was listening to every word and didn‚Äôt bat an eye lid, neither did anyone else.

s9o26k," I saw a post where some women were talking about how birth control pills give them flare ups and messes up their cycle, and then the topic of how women are the only ones putting in the work in terms of pregnancy prevention came up.

 These said individuals then suggested that men should get vasectomies done to lessen the ""burden"" on them. I empathise with them, and believe me that if there was a pill that men could take to prevent pregnancy, they'd take it in a heartbeat. But getting a vasectomy is equivalent to getting your tubes tied. And for most men, that's not an option. Especially, for people who plan on having kids in the future. I know it's reversible, but that may come with its own complications.",You can't compare getting a vasectomy to taking birth control pills,2.0,2.0
seafhe,"I was looking for an apartment with 1 room and carpark near Melb CBD. Found one with 2 carpark which I thought was a great deal. During the inspection, I didn't get to see the carpark but I was assured by the agent that there are two car spaces available. But there was no evidence since it was an oral promise rather than through email.

My renting application was successfully approved and I signed the contract immediately as property for rent is in short supply at the moment. I noticed on the contract there is only 1 carspace listed, then emailed the property manager if the two carspaces are reserved. She got back to me with ""1 car park in the basement, and public 2-hour parking on the street"". The 2-hour parking are literally your paid street-side parking for $3 per hour.

How is that even legal advertising? There are actually 30 or so public car spaces on the street, you wouldn't advertise for 30 car spaces would you?

I know I'm in a disadvantaged position since I already signed the leasing contract. I was still happy with the apartment, even with 1 parking at this price I thought it is fair. I only need one carpark anyway. Not looking for any potential solutions But just wanted to rant this out cuz I was so angered by their bullshit and didn't call it earlier.

Update: Thank you everyone for your suggestions. I contacted the consumer affairs was suggested the best I could do is to negotiate for a rent reduction, otherwise I can lodge a VCAT dispute.

sa3enk,"Disclaimer, this thread is a bit southern Maine focused, but any city/ town could be named. So we all know that people are getting pushed out of Portland because of house prices, taxes, etc. I have a lot of friends in their late 20s or early 30s who will die on this spending hill, because they really want to live in Portland. They refuse to look for a house anywhere but in Portland, or places directly next door like SoPo. 

I moved to the Saco/Biddeford recently, and I‚Äôm really enjoying it. I think this area is developing like crazy and will slowly become a more popular option for younger people, but right now a lot of people I know still consider anything outside of Portland a huge downgrade. 

So prediction is that Saco/Biddeford will become more popular over the next few years- what do you all think? What other cities or towns are ‚Äútrending‚Äù in Maine? For example, do you predict areas north of Portland to be the next big thing to develop? L/A? Or even west of Portland like Standish, Buxton, etc? Just genuinely curious what people think about how Maine will develop.

EDIT: Ok everyone I get it, I sound like an asshole because I wrote the word ‚Äútrending‚Äù, I am more curious from a real estate development perspective. This is a very real topic that comes up a lot among people looking to buy a house in my age group in southern Maine. Everyone wants to be in Portland and nobody wants to leave, and people are killing their wallets for it. I have friends who live in Oxford/Paris and that's all they could afford, so they are always talking about how they hope it will blow up...I know other people saying ""buy in Lewiston/Auburn now and it will pay off in 10 years when L/A becomes cool."" So this was meant to be a genuine thread for discussion...not meant as pretentious thing. Sorry for my weird wording.","Which town or city in Maine do you think will be the next cool, trending place to live?",2.0,2.0

**Wednesday 19th January:**

We start the day following [rumours](https://twitter.com/joepike/status/1483544562631020544?s=21) from journalists last night that Graham Brady, the chairman of the 1922 Committee of the Conservative Party, had received the required 54 (15% of Tory MPs) letters required to trigger an internal party vote of no confidence in Boris Johnson. If this is true and Johnson loses the VoNC, it will trigger a leadership challenge within the Conservative Party. The winner of that challenge will become the Tory leader and as a result, the Prime Minister.

There is another [rumour](https://twitter.com/STVKathryn/status/1483562077478342656) that Graham Brady will give a statement this morning. Regardless, things seem to be moving fast. The last time there was a VoNC within the Conservative Party was against Theresa May in December 2018, which she won 200-117. She eventually stood down as leader of the party in June 2019.

sb89py,"This lesson may not be started until Lesson 1 has been completed. The courses much be completed in order. However, they may be completed at your own pace. I do recommend that each course be completed promptly in order to complete your transformation as soon as possible. A braindead slut is a good slut. xoxo, Miss. Bunny

Welcome ladies to your next lesson in the ProMisogyny Training Academy for Girls. This is Miss. Bunny, HeadBitch of the academy. I'm so happy you have joined me for class. In our previous lesson, you learned how to break the binding chains of mainstream feminism. Today you are going to learn how to give into your natural, feminine sexual desires, which are to submit to, serve, and pleasure men.

Before we get started, we are going to recite the Mission Statement of our academy. Ready? Okay, ""We are objects for the pleasure of men. We will learn how to be a subservient, inferior set of holes for any man who comes into contact with us with all of our mind, body, heart, and soul.""

To begin, I want you to get out a piece of paper and a pen. On the top of this piece of paper, I want you to write ""I will no longer pretend I want to be respected and seen as equal to men. I want to give into my feminine nature and submit to men. Giving into my natural sexual desires are good, and will make me a better object for men. Submitting to men is my natural purpose."" Did you get that written down? Hold onto this, we will use it later.

Now that we have worked our way through clearing our stupid little heads of the lies of feminism, let's think about our true, natural purpose. What is that ladies? Correct, to serve men. What does this look like? It manifests itself in our natural, sexual desires. When we block everything else out, and think of what makes us turned on, what makes us dripping wet- it is being used by men. It is men having their way with us. It is pleasuring men. Don't forget ladies. Man's seed is precious. It keeps us obedient and desperate for more cock.

This is why the porn industry objectifies women, and promotes misogyny. Not only does it keep men happy and ready to use our bodies, it also caters to women's natural, biological urges. Women should see pornographic content that is demeaning, and strive to recreate that for the men they serve. Women should see themselves in that content. It is a big part of our training material- the more degrading and humiliating it is, the more we should consume it.

I want to go back to the portion of our lesson on exposing yourself to entertainment that promotes worshipping men. Now that your head is nice and clear and impressionable, these forms of entertainment will be even more useful in reprogramming your mind. I want you to find a video, or an audio, or a piece of written work and consume it. Make sure this media is misogynistic and degrading. If you have any questions about the content of anything you found, and if it fits the criteria, leave it in the comments section, and I will let you know. Once you are finished, I want you to meditate on it. Turn the lights off, turn on some gentle lighting, and get comfy. Think about what you have just consumed. What comes to mind? What do you feel? How does it make you feel? Write it down on your notebook paper.

These forms of entertainment are key to opening up your mind to a world of submission, free use, and  ultimate pleasure for both men and women. Especially men. Men are visual and sexual people- they see things and want those things. We need to be free for men to fulfil their desires by leaving our holes open and available for their use.

Ladies, start taking notes. Get out of the habit of wearing underwear. If a man were to walk up to you in the street and lift up your skirt, your holes should be exposed for Him to relieve Himself with. Underwear are pointless bunnies, all it does is create a barrier between men and our holes. No matter what you are wearing- a skirt, dress, shorts, or jeans, leave the underwear at home. You'll feel so cute and submissive when your dripping wet pussy feels the gentle breeze outside. 

When you pleasure yourself, practice your demeaning, cock worshipping, dirty talk. As you fuck yourself with your dildo, imagine a man you have submitted to on the other end. Practice what you would say to him as he is blessing you with his cock. Some phrases I recommend being with are- ""Sir (or other preferred honorific can be inserted here), please pound me with your throbbing cock"", ""Sir, your cock feels so good in my tight cocksleeve"", ""Sir, please shoot your Precious Seed into my fertile pussy. Claim me as your pet please sir"", ""Harder, harder, harder please sir."" Don't forget your manners as you do so.

Your assignment for Lesson 1: Underneath your notes for today's lesson, I want you to number the page 1-5. You can skip spaces if you'd like. I have 5 questions I want you to answer. 1. Have you ever submitted to a man? 2. How will giving into your natural sexual urges make your life better? 3. If you could, in 1 sentence, tell other women why they should embrace their natural sexual purpose, what would you say? 4. What was your biggest takeaway from today's lesson? 5. Do you have any additional questions for me? Extra credit: comment a photo of yourself in public with no underwear on (you can send this to me in a direct message if you are more comfortable.)

Alright ladies, I hope you enjoyed your lesson today. Next time we will be learning how to attract men to you by matching the outside to your inside. Stay obedient. Stay dumb. Stay beautiful. Xoxo, Miss. Bunny",Lesson 2- Giving Into Your Natural Sexual Desires,2.0,2.0

rv31gl,"Men know that women like lean athletic bodies, men with charisma and drive and men who are ambitious. The statistics about this are clear. However most men are overweight or obese and more likely than not the men in this thread are overweight or obese. The men know women want dominant figures but roll over the minute an attractive woman says hello. They make barely enough money to take care of themselves and live with their parents. If you are failing with women it is because you have not maximized your SMV.

Women know that men crave attractive bodies and a soft and kind spirit. Yet they are even more overweight than men are. Many women use female empowerment to defend toxic behaviors that make them unappealing in relationships. Many times they are entitled and demand that you spend your time giving them everything for nothing.

In conclusion you have no right to complain unless you have maximized your SMV. If you are overweight, under employed, live with your parents and cannot hold a decent conversation you have no right to complain. Just accept your low worth and improve yourself.",Both women and men know what to do to be more sexually attractive. They refuse to improve though.,2.0,2.0

sc4pgk,"Let me preface by saying that I am aware that men slut shame women a lot than women do but it is a behavior that I notice. It can range from being subtle and casual to blatant and insulting. I probably guess why men slut shame women, it's a means of controlling female sexuality or more accurately male sexuality. Men envy the fact that women have a means of controlling sex and they hate that it's something they want and need but can't have on a whim so they shame women for flaunting it so they can feel better about their own powerlessness. 

Women slut-shaming other women is a little more confusing. It may be internalized misogyny and I'm sure that's definitely part of it but it's not the nail of the head. There is nothing wrong with a woman having lots of sex after all. One suggestion I think of is that maybe ""sluts"" compromise the sex withholding power of women and are shamed by other women for it. I came to this idea when I was reading the play *Lysistrata.* For those who don't know  *Lysistrata* is a play about a woman rallying the other women of Athens and Sparta to not have sex with their husbands in order to get the cities to stop fighting. I do recall a scene where some women try to sneak out and bail on the plan and are subsequently ridiculed. Another theory is maybe since women in second-wave feminist movements worked so hard to have themselves not be portrayed as only objects of sensuality that women who show a lot of skin or have a lot of sex undermine that goal (Even though it's men who place that image in the first place) sexual liberation was a huge part of the counter culture and second feminism so while I get why men slut shame but why do certain women do it?",Why is slut shaming a behavior among certain women?,2.0,2.0

sctp5t,"1) Just talk to her like she‚Äôs a person. Don‚Äôt psyche yourself out. Don‚Äôt try to smother her with compliments and sexual innuendos and shit, since that will just make you seem desperate and make her uncomfortable. If she‚Äôs physically attracted to you and she can see that you‚Äôre a decent person she‚Äôll be interested in having a date. She will respect you treating her like a normal person not a sex object. There‚Äôs no magic pick up lines or push pull or disqualifying or anything like that needed. Stop complicating something that‚Äôs natural. 

2) Establish a man to woman frame asap. Be bold and direct and flirtatious to let her know you‚Äôre interested. Women respect a guy who goes for what he wants. Any old guy can walk over and have a platonic chat with her, you have to make her feel something or she won‚Äôt bother with you. Being attractive and friendly definitely help but they aren‚Äôt usually enough to seal the deal. Look at Todd V, an ugly little schmuck who ( apparently) gets beautiful women because of his advanced game.

Against assassins: Frostfire, edge of night  
Against tanks: Divine sunderer, Black Cleaver  
Against squishies: Eclipse, lethality  
If your team is full of bruisers/tanks: Moonstone, Umbral  


The rest of the build is dependant - they have heals? Chempunk chainsword. They have lots of shields? Serpants fang. Against a normal comp I love the mythic/black cleaver/wits end combo.

I told him that I have been exploring my sexuality more through Reddit and porn and that I am bisexual. His simple response was ‚ÄúI know and I‚Äôm so glad you know now too.‚Äù

I was honestly shocked and asked him how long he thought I was bi and he said since they day he met me. We have been together for almost 10 years. I find myself highly attracted to more androgynous ‚Äúbutch‚Äù women. I am not sure about what terms are okay so sorry if I am using incorrect terminology.

He then went on to say that we should go to sex therapy to talk about opening up the marriage, just for me, so that I can experience what it is like to be with a women because he feels like I missed out on exploring that side of myself. He said it is not fair to me to deny a part of myself and that he thinks it would be healthy for me to experience.

I‚Äôm shocked, happy, a little confused and don‚Äôt really know where to go from here. Any ideas on what I can do to start understanding the bi community better?

s5gbo8,"I've always been close to all three of my siblings. My oldest brother, Collin, pretty much raised us due to serious neglect and parentification. I realize what a sacrifice that is and that he should not have been doing all he did. We are all no contact with our mother.

Collin is engaged to Darcy. Our mom briefly dated Darcy's dad (very briefly, we were never anything close to stepsiblings and Collin was living at college at the time) Darcy was the most popular girl at school and she could be really mean. I know her family was crazy toxic and she was lashing out, but still no excuses to bully.

Darcy didn't like that her dad was dating a woman with kids and Darcy and I got into a verbal argument once because we were home alone at her dad's house and she announced my family is trashy, social climbers, and my mom is a whore. We got into it and said some mean stuff. Apparently I hurt Darcy's feelings, so her and her friends set up a prank at school and had a popular boy I like ask me to prom, and a few days before told me it was a joke.

Collin was pissed but a few hours away at college. My other brother did try to avenge me (which led to our parents breaking up, but Darcy's dad already had his next GF lined up so that was inevitable) Collin and Darcy reconnected years later and have been together for 3 years and the wedding is in May. I know it might sound petty but I was a shy insecure girl and what she did gutted me.

Darcy has apologized. Collin thinks I should forgive her because she was a kid and she was acting how her dysfunctional parents taught her to act and has since grown up. I told him I was sorry but I just couldn't go. To be honest it brings up a lot of my insecurities and I don't want to see her get this huge princessy wedding with everyone fawning over her. My sister thinks i should let it go, my other brother loves Darcy and treats her like a sister.

Darcy recently sent me a text about she's sorry but I'm being awful to Collin and how he had no childhood because he was trying to protect me from our insane mother and how he shouldn't have been walking to the store at 12 to make sure I could eat, and after all of that I owe him this. i've yet to reply and I keep going back and forth about if I'm being an asshole or not.",AITA for refusing to go to my brother's wedding because of what the bride did to me?,2.0,2.0

s8dmb6,"edit 2: ethan‚Äôs response https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zrg8garWQ

unfortunately i paid $24 for access to Nick's patreon so I can learn about what happened. here's a list of general details I got from the 21 minute video, chronologically:

* starts off the video by saying he sent an email to Dan stating he was canceling the interview. Nick's no longer comfortable with the interview and that there's multiple reasons

* points out that all, but one, of his collabs with people have been super nice and respectful, but believes Ethan is only looking for a ""shitshow"" and a ""Trisha Paytas replacement"" for the podcast

* problem with no boundaries, unprofessional, specifically about Ethan talking about financials and personal accommodations publicly on youtube and him making the joke up about the m&ms request and lying that Nick initiated the contract proposal

* says there's a limit to how much he can take in regards to Ethan's humor/degradation and that his most recent H3TV video was the deciding factor for the cancellation 

* doesn't believe Ethan can make fun of his ""fatness"" and ""gayness"" and belittling him

* had issue with the podcast talking about his Onlyfans Day 1, making a point how if he were a woman they wouldn't be talking about him like that

* states he did not plan to cancel, explaining he was thinking of going for 2 weeks and collab with friends before this

* goes on a small rant about viewership drop on his videos about Ethan on his channel, claiming his audience doesn't seem to care for Ethan

* he doesn't have ""much to gain from this"" and that Ethan overstates the ""exposure"" he'll receive from their interview claiming he would've seen an effect by now

* he's not taking any money and the contract proposal was only if the podcast canceled due to an emergency after Nick arrives to California

* Nick says part of it may be insecurities, doesn't feel comfortable putting himself in a situation where people will degrade him about his weight and sex work, even if they're paying him

* talks about ‚ô•olivia‚ô• and how he only feels bad about canceling because of her, seems appreciative of her as a fan. hopes her flight was refundable, but that he ultimately ""can't mix emotions with business""

* has never had to get asked questions about his weight, sex work, etc. and ""have to answer to it and to see them make fun of it""

* *kinda gets weird and a bit hard to understand here but..* points out his lawsuits (although he points out how they're unjust), how there's drama with Ethan, and ""not to get him started with some of the comments he makes about society, pop culture, trendy stuff, like, he's someone who thinks trigger warning is effective ... he's one of those people who use trigger warnings before saying something ... I just don't like him"". says that's all he'll say about that because he doesn't like to get political

* *this parts funny,* starts ranting about ""the guy"" Ethan podcasts with. Mispronounces Hasan's name about 8 times and how he ""annoys the fuck out of him"". ""These people are sooo.. eurgh. Annoys the fuck out of me. That's not Ethan's fault but"" *not sure what's he referring to exactly here but.. I'll assume hopefully it's about politically far left entertainers*

* moves on, acknowledges paywalling the explanation video was trashy but that it's ""a trashy profession""

* reiterates most points already listed, how it's not worth ""going into a lions den"" and how most of ""Ethan's stans"" don't like him

* ""not excited about this anymore so you know what, let's listen to my gut, I'm.. I.. no, you blew it. You blew it."" 


the end

this might had gone on for too long but whatever, I'd hate to see any misinformation going around about this. I apologize if I did not explain myself well enough in some parts or if I misunderstood parts of the video (correct me if I'm wrong). Feel free to ask me any questions.. I'm gonna go get baked and rethink my life choices. Please don't ask me to share the video for obvious reasons, seriously. 

___


**NOTE:** I do not believe Ethan nor Nick deserve any form of harassment over this. There's a productive middle ground to be had here where maybe we can learn something new or acknowledge a different perspective. Please offer some consideration and don't be mean, with peace and love.

I met this guy I liked I slept with him on the second date after spending the whole day together. It felt nice but I still unfulfilled and empty. We kept in contact, the other day he told me about this girl he considers a very good friend, he said they didn't sleep together even after various dates and I couldn't help but to compare myself and feel like a whore, wondering if he thought of me as an easy catch and that's why he showed interest.

sbxh7s,"The year is 1997, you are at primary school and it is lunchtime.

The sun is shinning, kids are playing hop-scotch on the hot concrete, the playground is a buzz with noise and it is busy at the equpitment shed; an assortment of bats, balls, hula-hops, jump-ropes are being handed out, many faded and marked with much use.

Nearby, water splashes from a fountain and quickly evaporates as it hits the ground, making a strange noise as it does. The sports field is piled high with mounds of fortified cut grass.

You however are standing in the shade leaning up against a wall, you wait there as this is where you need to wait for what is to come. Earlier that day you took an envelope to the school office, in it was an assortment of coins and a lunch order.

You hear in the distance the familiar sound of a gate being opened, and the rumble of a car slowly approaching. Your suspicions are confirmed when a dark blue Mitsubishi Galant station wagon makes its way into view, a small crowd of kids begin to gather; cautioned by the teacher that is standing watch.

Out from the car steps a man; which you know to be the dairy owner from around the corner, he walks to the back of the car and lifts open the boot to reveal the many paper bags arranged inside cardboard boxes within. A number of the bags contain pies, sausage rolls, sandwiches, cinnamon donuts etc, there is even a box that contains an assortment of Juices. But none of these are the prize which you seek.

Your excitement begins to build.

If your stomach had a brain (as it often feels like it does) it would daydream about what is to come. Pink icing and glaze cresting an otherwise standard hotdog bun, simple enough, but to you this is peak baking. Nothing in your mind could possibly top the sticky sweet raspberry euphoria that is soon to be consumed with carefully calculated bites.

Amid the controlled chaos your name is called and your order is received with a ""hello"", a ""thank you"" and a ""goodbye"". The transaction streamlined with much practiced use, you now have what you have lusted after; a single bun selected by fate from a pack of 6.

Unbeknownst to you, years later this particular company will add coconut to the icing mix (you don't mind coconut, but it dampens the artificial raspberry flavouring that you have long enjoyed) and then eventually they will phase out the raspberry bun altogether.

Unbeknownst to you this day will one day just be a memory, one of many which will be looked back at and its simple joys.

Much like Gatsby's Green Light seen from the end of his dock the raspberry bun will remain the symbol of ""the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter--tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther.... And one fine morning-- So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.‚Äù",Memoirs of a school kid.,2.0,2.0

s6fovt,"Short Version:  

I went for a drive in Sally Gap last Friday night and was chased by a 4x4 for no apparent/real reason. Nothing bad happened after all but I wonder how can someone put others at risk only for a laugh. 

Long version:

One of my favourite things to do is driving. Sometimes after a hectic week working from home I like to jump in the car and go for a drive late in the evening. It works like therapy for me. Last Friday the night sky was quite clear around Dublin so I decided to head towards Sally Gap through Ballycullen Rd. Although it was already dark I was really enjoying the place. The moon was very bright so I could see every single hill rolling far in the distance. It was so beautiful. I never really experienced the Old Military Road at night with such a clear sky. 

A few kilometres after that big straight past the Kippure Hill entrance I came across what looked like a big 4x4 coming in the opposite direction. This person had what I would safely describe as the brightest head lights I've ever seen in my life. It's lighting setup was quite impressive to be fair. I noticed it had the headlights, a pair of big auxiliar lights close to the bumper and a light bar installed on the roof. When it got closer I couldn't see shit in front of my car. My reaction was to flash my high beams in an attempt to remind that person of how bright his lights were. Well, it didn't work at all but I managed to pass him without issues apart from getting dazzled.  

A few moments later I noticed in the mirror a bright light coming in the same direction as me far in the distance and at some point it started getting bigger and bigger. The confirmation came when I was able to distinguish that same super bright light bar floating over two pairs of headlights. It was back. Did the driver got offended with my poor high beams flashing at his face? When I reached Sally Gap's crossing I decided to take the right towards Blessington. The 4x4 repeated my move and managed to get even closer. At this point the 4x4 started tailgating me. It was so close that I could clearly hear his engine even with all my windows shut. The whole interior of my car was lit by its lights and the narrow road ahead looked like a bright summer day. The 4x4 kept revving its engine inches from my bumper for about 3km while I tried to keep normal speed, specially because the road there is quite bumpy. After we crossed a bridge I think the other driver got bored, turned around and went back up to the Old Military Road. And that was the end of my little ""DUEL"" experience.

I don't know WTF happened there but I could bet it was just some knob head with a big car having a laugh on random people, trying to scare them and potentially causing an accident. I admit I got a little concerned in the beginning as there was only the two of us on the road but I thankfully managed to keep myself calm. A more anxious or inexperienced driver would have thrown their car into the ditch trying to evade that imbecile. 

Have you guys ever seen something like this happening up there? I've been doing these drives for years and nothing like this ever happened to me apart from a couple of speeding idiots occasionally. 

Anyways. Apologies for the long post.","I was ""chased"" by a random 4x4 up in the Wicklow Mountains.",2.0,2.0

I was working in his living room whilst he was ""working"" in his room. I went to go see him and I see he's at his desk stroking his cock to some porn. He was watching a video of a girl, who looked so like me that I thought he had secretly recorded me, and a guy with the biggest cock I have ever seen! The girl was skinny with blonde-brown hair, small boobs (slightly smaller than mine) and admittedly a little bit hotter than me. I'm not going to lie, catching my boyfriend jerking off is such a big fantasy for me but I thought I would use this to have some fun :). I watched him for a bit and when I thought he was getting close I stormed in and went crazy at him.

I told him to show me what he was watching and made him get out of his desk chair. I started to watch the porn and asked him if this is what he liked? He was just standing there next to me with his cock out, still half hard and I knew I had control over this situation. I pulled my jeans down, took off my tank top  and sat down in his chair. I started rubbing my clit infront of him, my eyes fixed on my boyfriends laptop. He went to touch his cock but I stopped him. With my other hand I started to touch him very gently, stroking his cock which was now wet with precum.

I took my hand off his cock and put it insdie myself and started to work harder on making myself cum. By this point my pussy was so wet it had started to make the chair wet. I started to get really close and looked over at my boyfriend's now very hard cock. I made myself cum right infront of him, I loved every second of it. I licked the precum off his cock and told him to put his trousers on. I didn't make him cum until the evening of the next day when I let him cum inside me.

I told him later that I found this really hot and that I was secretly hoping I would one day catch him touching himself. I didn't want him to feel shame around this type of thing because I think it's absolutely fine to watch porn and please yourself without your parnter being there :).

2. To add to the previous question, can a guy still be the man of the house if he's letting his wife peg him?

3. Anal itself turns me off most of the time (dirty and damaging), and being submissive to a woman in any way other than pegging turns me off too.

sf2dqu,,What are some good Sweet Dee-heavy episodes I can watch tonight to cheer me up?,,
sa4hu1,"I believe that there are as many genders as society says there are, because it is a social construct. It is something that society made up. Why exactly we thought it made sense or was a good idea to create these arbitrary roles and rules for ourselves I don't know, I'm not a history major, but honestly if it were up to me there wouldn't be any such thing as gender. I think the whole concept is just divisive and in general gender polarization is harmful to society. I don't think the concept serves any purpose anymore, and the whole idea has gotten way too complicated (not because we're saying that there's more than two now, but because of the way you're supposed to base such a large part of your identity and personality off of what sex organs you were born with, which society also decided should be covered up most of the time.)

I don't think there are two genders because I can clearly observe that most of what gender is is only strongly correlated with biological sex (again, only because society says so) rather than being an actual extension of our biology. There's nothing biological about expecting females to wear what us humans call ""dresses"" and expecting males NOT to, often finding it strange/odd/funny when they do. There's nothing biological about believing that the color blue is masculine while pink is feminine (infact, less than 100 years ago blue was FEMININE. The main two genders we're most familiar with are always changing too. This helps prove that it's just something society made up. Another example is that not long before blue was considered feminine, it was normal for young males to wear dresses.) Basically, my point is that, somewhere in an alternate universe, males are the ones who wear dresses and carry purses, while females don't, and get judged if they do. Nothing else is different in that alternate universe, and nothing in that alternate universe doesn't make any less sense than it does in this universe.

So if this is the case, why couldn't there be more than two genders? What if I was the type of person to wear dresses and carry purses but also really liked the color blue, and was very muscular? Sure, you can try to tell me that that's just a man in a dress or just a woman with muscles depending on what my biology may be, but since when can't I call that a third gender? It clearly doesn't fit perfectly into either of the usual two. Going with the alternate universe thought experiment again, what if instead of gender, it was that every male in this world is taught that they must grow up to be a doctor, and every female a lawyer. Where males get harshly judged by many if they would rather be lawyers. Where, when a male decides to be an engineer rather than a doctor, they get told ""there's only 2 professions you can't just make up a new one called 'engineer' you're just a doctor that likes to tinker around"" That world is a pretty stupid world, and I think that logic translates to this world.

So far the only things I've heard in opposition to this are ""God created two genders"" which doesn't really carry much weight, and ""XY chromosomes = boy, XX chromosomes = girl, it's that simple"" which anyone with an education in biology can tell you, is actually not that simple. I'm hoping to hear something that makes more sense than this.

Hijacking my own post to highlight a specific issue that's addressed in the podcast:

[Trusted News Initiative (TNI) discussion thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/ruu6mu/mass_censorship_the_trusted_news_initiative_tni/?)

The Trusted News Initiative (TNI) is a key part to understanding how and why any criticism of the vaccine is being censored. That topic alone needs its own thread. There's a lot to unpack in this main thread, so there isn't a whole lot of space for a discussion about TNI that needs to happen.

# Preface

Joe Rogan has his podcast exclusively on Spotify. It's 3 hours long. Some people don't have Spotify. Some people don't have 3 hours to listen to a guy talk very slowly. I took the time to type out the main points brought forth by Dr. Malone. The podcast is about 95% Dr. Malone talking, with the remainder as Joe. If you do not have Spotify, you can listen to it from [this link here](https://odysee.com/@altmedia96:2/dr-robert-malone-joe-rogan-experience-1093:e) which is unlikely to be taken down.

Formatting:

1. When Dr. Malone speaks, I use the "">"" quote function. 
2. When Joe speaks, I put ""Joe:"" in front of the statement.
3. When I paraphrase a verbose point, I have it as a bullet. Interviews are often a bit rambly, especially when they're three hours long. When people try to get a point out, it tends to get dragged out as they try to on-the-fly figure out a way to describe it the best. I did *my* best to boil it down to what they were actually trying to say, using their own vocabulary. I understand this may upset people, but that's why I link to the original podcast above.
4. When I skip through or alter a quote for sake of simplicity, it is in brackets ""[]"".
5. I sometimes add clarifying statements in parentheses.

Transcriptionst's Note:

This is simply a volunteer effort to let this information be more easily spread. At some point I'll spit this whole episode through an automated AI transcriber, but I don't exactly know how to do that. There is a lot of stuttering, stammering, and on-the-fly rewording that I've left out, so I do not consider my omission of those instances as being unfaithful to the dialogue. I've also left out a lot of side-talk like ""wow"" and ""oh my gosh"", ya know the thing that Joe Rogan does a lot. I deliver information in chronological order as it is presented in the interview. At the time of this post, this will not be the final iteration and is subject to change and improvement. If you have an issue with the way I've transcribed something, please include what you would like me to edit and I will. If you have the studies that Dr. Malone references, please consider including it in a comment so that I can paste it where appropriate. I greatly recommend that you listen to the full podcast if possible. Feel free to cross-post this to your underground communities.

## Dr. Malone's testimony about himself:

- Robert was present in the main labs that were responding to the very first HIV outbreak

- Developed a series of technologies about how to manufacture mRNAs, structure it and eventually put it into cells (eventually leading to the development of these COVID vaccines) 

- Robert has been involved in every major outbreak since AIDS

- Has won billions of dollars in federal grants

- Brought in by NIH to serve as the ""study section chair""

- Countless hours working for the CDC, has many friends in the CDC

- A "" deep insider"" in terms of government 

- Has known Tony Fauci personally, has worked with him his entire career 

- Does not receive any money from the popularity of his tech

- De-platformed from LinkedIn for noting a conflict of interest regarding officials in Pfizer 

- was reinstated after LinkedIn admitted they didn't have the ""talent to fact check him""

- Was de-platformed again after a Microsoft fact checker concluded that Robert was an ""anti-vaxxer"" and was therefore deserving of a ban

- Banned from twitter but unsure what specific tweet kicked him off (Twitter never tells)

- Suspects that it was one of two tweets that had to do with informing Pfizer vaccine potential defects, as well as how large information-direction organizations are dealing with COVID media

## Main Interview:

>I've tried to make sure people have access to the information about those risks and potential benefits, the true unfiltered academic papers and raw data, etc...

>The policy being implemented is one in which no discussion of the risks are allowed, because by definition they will allow vaccine hesitance. Because of this, Informed Consent is not happening, and it is in fact being blocked.

>There's a CIA agent I've co-published with in the past named Michael Calahan. He was in Wuhan in the 4th quarter of 2019. He called me from Wuhan on January 4th. At this time I was managing a team that was focusing on drug discovery for organo-phosphate poisoning, ergo nerve agents, for DTRA (Defense Threat Reduction Agency), involving high performing computing and bio-robot screening. He told me, ""Robert, you've gotta get your team spun up because we've got a problem with this new virus."" I've worked with him through prior outbreaks. So it was then when I turned my attention to this. I started modelling a key protein of this virus, a protease inhibitor, when the sequence was released on January 11th as the ""Wuhan Seafood Market Virus."" I've been going nonstop on this ever since (to that point, with drug repurposing). I'm the one that originally discovered famotidine as an agent because I was self-treating myself after I got infected with agents that we identified through our computer modelling.


>I was up up up on all the latest information from China and everywhere else. I knew all about this virus. I watched all the videos of people dropping in the street. My lungs were burning until I took famotidine, otherwise known as Pepcid.

- Today (Dec 31) the first patient is enrolled in clinical trials for the combination of famotidine and celecoxib for treating SARS/COVI-2. It is based on Malone's discoveries.

- We had data to show that Ivermectin improves the combination [famotidine and celecoxib], but the FDA created enormous roadblocks to us doing an Ivermectin arm that we had to drop it. The FDA created so much grief that the DOD decided the ""juice wasn't worth the squeeze"".

- It's not just Ivermectin [that they're putting a stop to], it's also hydroxychloroquine.

> There is good modelling studies that probably half a million excess deaths have happened in the United States through the intentional blockade of early treatment by the US government. Half a million. That is a well-documented number. And that's about the combination of hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin.

> If you ask me why this is happening, you're asking me to get into somebody's head. What I can say as a scientist is what I can observe: the behaviors, the actions, the correspondence.

- Zev Zelenko [...] clearly documents the conspiracy between Janet Woodcock and Rick Bright to make it so that physicians could not administer hydroxychloroquine outside of the hospital.

- Rick Bright was head of the BARDA (Biomedical Advance Research and Development Authority) which is the group that, for instance, funded the J&J vaccine and Operation Warp Speed, etc... 
- BARDA is the ""big ticket funder"" of bio defense products
- Janet Woodcock was head of Operation Warp Speed for drugs, and until very recently head of the FDA. She is known as the person that kind of gets the credit for the Opioid Crisis for her role at the FDA.

>Rick Bright in videotaped testimony has explicitly spoken about how they conspired to cook up a strategy using Emergency Use Authorization to make it so that hydroxychloroquine could only be administered in the hospital which is far too late for when hydroxychloroquine should be used.

Joe: Why do they do that?

> That is what is the unknown. And there are so many whys and hows behind this. There's a stack of stuff that doesn't make sense that's about this high [hand gesture]. I can't get into Rick's head, though I know Rick quite well. He's currently working for the Rockefeller. He did a whistleblower case and then he left the government. All I know is that they did this, and that Rick admits on videotape that he did it. He claims that the reason was is that he believed there was no evidence of hydroxychloroquine being useful for this virus. Now that's false. Hydroxychloroquine was known to be effective against SARS-1.

> Hydroxy is one of the few molecules that have antiviral activity that is safe in pregnancy.

> The other part of Rick's story that kinda doesn't make sense, that there was no data of efficacy, is that I was the guy that first acquired, because I had Chinese connections, the Chinese protocol for treating this virus. I got it in late February, and I sent it in to my buddies at the CIA and it made it to the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response. So, the government had those documents when Rick Bright made those determinations. The assertion that there was no data on the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine is just false. It's there. What is the motivation? You're right. None of this makes sense.

> Both ivermectin and hydroxy are on the WHO list of essential medicines. They have been administered for millions and millions of doses. They are among the safest medicines we know when administered within the acceptable pharmaceutical window. Ivermectin is even safer than hydroxy. So Merck coming out of the blue and saying ivermectin isn't safe is really inexplicable.

> I sit on the Active Committee for drugs as an observer. The Active Committee is the NIH committee that's guiding the clinical trials for these various repurposed and novel drugs. I saw, listened to, heard, and witnessed the representative of Merck that's on the committee, because the committee is full of pharmaceutical representatives even though it's an NIH public committee, explicitly attack the decision for the federal government to test ivermectin. She said there's no reason to do this. Since then, Active Sticks(?) is still testing ivermectin and they've had to go to a higher dose because as we pointed out, essentially the trials were designed to fail.

> There is clearly a concerted effort on the part of multiple players in the pharmaceutical industry in concordance with the federal government to kill ivermectin as a potential alternative early treatment strategy.

Joe: And if you were going to follow the money, the problem is there's no a lot in ivermectin because it is a generic drug and any compound pharmacy can make it. And it's fairly cheap.

> It's fairly cheap because it's easy to make. You can buy ivermectin in bulk for less than a penny a dose.

- The Chinese government has been using hydroxychloroquine, with effective results. Though, they have not been using ivermectin. 

- The virus was ripping through Uttar Pradesh, India. Uttar Pradesh has 2/3 the population as the entire United States but is only 2% of its square mileage. The decision was made out of desperation to deploy early treatments as packages widely throughout the province. The package contained a number of agents, the composition of which has not been formally disclosed. It was done in coordination with the WOH, and whatever was in those package was rumored to include ivermectin, but there was a specific visit of Biden to Narendra Modi (Prime Minister of India). There was an explicit decision in the Indian government not to disclose the contents of those packages. Uttar Pradesh has flatlined in terms of deaths, while the US is still somehow struggling with Covid.

Joe: Isn't there some evidence that the vaccine actually helps people with Long Covid?

> That was the rumor at the time. No there is no evidence. Anecdotally there was, but since then what we do know, for sure and well documented, if you've got prior Covid and natural immunity, you have a higher risk of adverse events from the jab.

- People who have natural immunity have a much higher risk factor for the whole spectrum of adverse effects, between 2 or 4-fold, if they get the jab.

Joe: But even though that's known, there are so many people out there telling people who have just recovered from Covid to get vaccinated.

> It's nucking futs. It's just wrong.

- According to the study in Israel with 2.5 million people, [natural immunity] is about 27-fold better at protecting against developing the disease (note: infection does not equal disease).

- That is only 1 in over 140 studies that document that natural immunity is superior to the vaccine induced immunity

> and by the way, as a vaccinologist and an immunologist, I wouldn't expect anything different.

- The CDC disputes this despite the evidence using a very small study with intrinsic bias, much smaller than the Israeli study, much less rigorous statistical power. The CDC study did this themselves. 

Joe: So they funded this study, they did it themselves, and do you believe they did it with the intent of coming to the conclusion-

> You're asking me to apply intent, and I've had too much time with lawyers and I'm not going to do it [chuckles]

> What we're experiencing is a coordinated media warfare the level of which we have never seen before. And I and my peers who are experienced in multiple outbreaks have never seen this level of coordinated propaganda.

- The TNI (Trusted News Initiative), which began fall of 2020, ties together big tech and big media in service of the government and was built expressly for the purpose of ""protecting our democracy and voting integrity from undue influence from hostile offshore players through media information campaigns."" The TNI is the response of the Western nations to the alleged Russian interference. It surveys all information about elections to (allegedly) prevent intrusion of foreign information into the democratic process. Shortly after the TNI's creation, there was an awareness in the pharmaceutical industry that this organization could be used to address a particular challenge that they had: anti-vaxxers ""(the label that is used to take anybody out that raises concerns about vaccine safety. Anti-vaxxer is the pejorative that is applied making it really easy to basically take off the table anybody that is saying something contrary to the interests of the vaccine industry)."" The TNI has also been deployed against climate skeptics.

> So there was a decision that this same toolkit [TNI], this same integrated, international media and high tech organization, led by the BBC, would be pivoted to resisting ""vaccine misinformation and disinformation"". They let out a proud press announcement last fall that this is what they were going to do. They defined these things ""misinformation and disinformation"" as anything which was going to lead to vaccine hesitancy and which was contrary to the official statements of the WHO, or the respective national health organizations. [...] Whatever the CDC or Tony Fauci says is truth, by definition. Any information or discussion which is contrary to that truth will be suppressed, it will be deleted, and those people that are expressing these opinions that would lead to ""vaccine hesitancy,"" which to some eyes would be informed consent, that information will not be allowed. And those people that are spreading that information will not be allowed to interact in the public sphere in social media. If you want to unpack this whole thing, it starts with understanding the Trusted News Initiative.

- The authors of the Great Barrington Declaration, esteemed and full professors, were systematically deplatformed by the federal government for criticizing the effectiveness of vaccine lockdowns, and labled as ""fringe"" epidemiologists.

- Sweden used a hands off approach and handled Covid much more effectively than the US

- Israel has a financial deal with Pfizer and only use Pfizer vaccines. Israel is on their 4th dose. Israel, compared to its surrounding states who don't have that level of vaccine uptake at all, has a significantly higher mortality rate.

> Rate of infection is a hard variable because it is a function of the density of testing. The more you look for it, the more you find. The incidents of infection is completely contaminated by the frequency of testing and the density of testing. The only thing close to a decent outcome indicator that isn't subject to all this bias in the system, except in a few states: Iceland and Scandinavian states generally have relatively clean data, the UK to some extent has cleaner data, it is now clear that the Israeli dataset is contaminated by all kinds of monkey business in terms of what gets deleted... But, the only thing that seems close to a reasonable outcome variable is all-cause mortality.

- There are many variables that make it difficult to clearly define a vaccine-caused death, let alone a vaccine-correlated death. 

[Malone lists many examples of how difficult it is to define, such as co-morbidities and physical trauma.]

> All of these things you can't sort out what's what, you just have to take the aggregate value and hope that you have a large enough sample size that it corrects for all the [uncontrollable variable] noise that's inherent in the system.

Joe: Now you just glossed over the financial incentive to report a Covid death. What is that? What is the financial incentive? Because there are all these rumors that you would hear about what a hospital gets paid per Covid death and that the government gives them money, and that they're incentivized to make something- mark it down-

> They're not rumors. I don't have the specific numbers off the top of my head. I'm not a hospitalist or a hospital administrator. But, the numbers are quite large. They're something like a $3,000 death benefit to a hospital if it can be claimed to be Covid. There's a financial incentive to call somebody Covid positive. The CDC made the determination in year one. This is why all our baseline data is junk.

> The hospitals receive a bonus from the government, I think it's like 3,000 bucks, if someone is hospitalized and able to be declared Covid positive. They also receive a bonus, I think the total is something like $30,000 of incentive, if somebody gets put on the vent. Then they get a bonus is someone is declared death with Covid.

> The CDC made the determination that they were going to make a core assumption: if PCR positive and you die, that is ""Death due to Covid"". An extreme example just to show the absurdity: If a patient comes in with a bullet hole to the head, and they do a nose swap and come up PCR positive, they are determined to have died from Covid.

Joe: (in disbelief) But is that real?

> Yes

> For sure trauma and other things.

Joe: I've seen that said, but I've always thought that's ridiculous.

> It's not a question of what the hospital would do, it's a question of med codes.

Joe: So it really is true, that if someone has a gunshot wound, and they're dying of that gunshot wound, and if you check them for Covid, and if they're Covid positive, and they die, then they're marked off as a Covid death.

> That is by definition from the CDC. It was a decision that was made early on.

> The data has been so thoroughly manipulated that it's hard for any of us to make sense of it.

[Explanation of how laws and treaties work for clinical trials.]

> Over the last few years, the FDA made policy that the responsibility vests with the sponsor. That's fancy regulatory talk that Pfizer owns it. So you ask the question: Whose responsibility is it to ensure that the data isn't contaminated and manipulated? The answer is Pfizer.

> What gets reported in a study is often biased by how the study is structured. Because when you write the study protocol, you list the expected adverse effects. So if those things happen, often times those things get checked. But I guarantee one expected adverse events was not seizure and paralysis.

> There's all kinds of financial incentives to make bad stuff go away and highlight good stuff. It makes the sponsor happy. And then you get another contract. These are not little contracts. A modest contract is 20 million dollars. A big one is 100 million or more. These are big money deals. You want to keep that money flowing, and you want to keep your sponsor happy. So that's what has come out with the whistleblower from Pfizer is that the contractor, I think it's here in Texas, that ran a bunch of those clinical trials and appears to have manipulated data in a variety of ways. And this is done at the level of checking the data and reconciling the data and deciding which things go into the database and which things don't go into the database. And whether or not if someone had an adverse event after shot 1 and then they're dropped because they won't take shot 2. Do we drop them out of the overall study analysis? We have all this specific language that we use in our business: the ""intent to treat cohort,"" the ""per protocol cohort,"" these are separate analyses because its known that you can manipulate the data in these different ways.

- Thomson Reuters Organization has become the ""fact-checker"" of choice and is tied closely to Pfizer with common corporate ownership. They are the fact-checker of Twitter. Integrated on a board level. Thomson Reuters is making the decisions, which has connections to Pfizer, about what information is allowed to be discussed on Twitter. 

> (Speculation) If I was to follow the money [...] Hospitals are incentivized to treat Covid patients. If Covid patients are treated outside of the hospital and are therefore prevented from going to the hospital, such is the case in the imperial valley where Bryan Tyson and George Fareed have saved thousands and thousands of lives of indigenous Latinos [...], and if people are giving treatments that are keeping people out of the hospitals, then they're not getting that revenue.

- The people who are doing the attacking are almost universally hospital administrators and hospital-based physicians.

- There is a recent paper out of Hong Kong: Comprehensive Analysis Myocarditis in Boys Hospitalized. 

> The myocarditis was so bad after vaccination, and these are all verified post-vaccination. It was so bad that you went to the hospital. Incident rate is 1 in 2700. There's all kinds of handwaving that ""oh myocarditis is mild and the recover from it"". Those statements aren't, let's say, gently based in fact. Historic incidents of death post-myocarditis is about 27%. The assertion is ""well this is a different kind of myocarditis and therefore it's not going to kill these kids or young adults."" These things are being said in the absence of data. It's pure speculation.

Joe: I keep hearing that it's ""mild myocarditis"" and that it ""eventually goes away,"" but not citing any studies, and I don't think there are any long term studies.

> There can't be! [chuckles] By definition!

> I think I might be the only one that's deeply involved in the development of this tech that doesn't have a financial stake in it. So for me, the reason is, because what's happening is not right. It's destroying my profession. It's destroying the practice of medicine worldwide. It's destroying public health in medicine. I'm a vaccinologist. I've spent 30 years developing vaccine - a stupid amount of education learning how to do it and what the rules are. And for me, I'm personally offended by watching my discipline get destroyed for no good reason at all, except for apparently financial incentives and, I don't know, political ass-covering?

> There is a huge number of dysmenorrhea and menometrorrhagia, alterations in [menstrual cycles] in women.

> Then there are the women who are postmenopausal that have started bleeding.

> Why is this happening, what are the things that connect these things? What is it that drives menstruation. The answer is the ovary. The ovary is the controller through hormones and ovulation. What did we learn early on from the Pfizer data package? Which by the way, when that was disclosed by [name?] from Japan and sent to me, was the first thing that really lit me up and let me know that something here was rotten. When I got that, I picked out, as [name?] had done, I was given the task of independently evaluating it, and then I took that package and I gave it to a more senior regulatory professional that I respected and I said ""these are the things I see. This looks really bad."" He said ""Oh you missed this that and the other thing."" These missing things include reproductive toxicology, evaluations of teratogenicity (birth defects), standard stuff that's always done. Genotoxicity, not done. What was done was a cobbled together group of data that didn't even involve the vaccine. It used other mRNAs in non-GLP, that's fancy speak for ""not done with rigor"" or ""not according to the rules"" - all cobbled together and sent in to the regulatory agencies of the world to justify going and head and giving jabs to everybody under emergency use authorization. That's the truth of it. That's the short version using common language.

- An early test they did do was on rats showed that the mRNA goes to the ovary at a very high rate. This wasn't supposed to happen. It was supposed to stay in the arm at the injection site. It instead goes all over the body, and specifically to two places that are kind of anomalous: bone marrow and the ovaries. We can isolate it to the ovarian signal because it doesn't occur in testes. So we have a non-clinical trial (rat trial) that shows affects on the ovaries. And when it is deployed widely in humans, we continue to see the alteration in menstrual cycle.

- Rabbis of the Hasidic Jews had to closely monitor the effects on their women's menstrual cycles because of their religious concern with cleanliness (see the Pentateuch on menstrual cleanliness). There are strict rules on cleanliness during intercourse. These Rabbis, being very familiar with their women's menstrual cycles, immediately recognized disruptions in the menstrual cycles of their communities. They came out with a clear statement that children should not be vaccinated, authenticated by law. And with adults it was strongly discouraged.

> Your girls are born with all the eggs they'll ever have. And these lipids appear to be affecting menstruation in some way. But menstruation is just one of these adverse effects.

- The disease itself (Covid), the mRNA genetic vaccines, and the DNA virus administered genetic vaccines (J&J) all have these symptoms: clotting, brain fog, etc...

> We don't see these problems by the way - adenovirus vector vaccine have been in development for my entire life, 30 years. There are licensed adenovirus vector vaccines. So it's not something that's intrinsic to the platform. Well what is it? The common variable is spike. Just to cut to the chase.

Joe: Spike proteins?

> Yes.

[A lot of technical jargon in this segment somewhere around 1:30:00 that I'm honestly too tired to transcribe. He describes the effects lipids and proteins and spike etc...]

> It is the job of the pharmaceutical companies to prove that their genetically engineered spike is safe. They never did that. And so all of this pressure that comes back from folks like me [...] I get criticized because ""oh well prove that it's not safe."" I'm sorry, that's not the way it works. It's pharma's job to prove that it is safe. It's not my job to prove that it's not safe.

> Does it cause toxicity in people? I think the answer is pretty clear now: it does. The question we're asking now is: how often and how bad?

- There is a paper out that tried to explain the difference between Long Covid and post-vaccination syndrome. It concluded that the two are indistinguishable.

> There's this increasing awareness that there is some window of time after vaccination, not sure how long, when you're actually more susceptible to infection. So not only is the vaccine efficacy weaning, but the multiple jab strategy is actually creating more and more windows where people have this period of T-cell suppression.

Joe: This T-cell suppression, are there any studies on the amount of time that it takes before your system rebalances itself post-jab? 

> This is the obscenity for me of this whole, ""we're going to give four shots because we don't really know what to do and we need to do something."" I like to talk about the metaphor as a father: If you get a three year old a hammer, everything becomes a nail. That's kind of a simple way of saying people that aren't well trained given a powerful technology or tool will abuse it and overuse it. In this case there are multiple reasons not to do the multiple jabs. The simplest one for everybody to understand is, when your son develops seasonal allergies to pollen or whatever and its so bad that he can't go to school you say ""oh well lets take him to an allergist"". What do they do? They give him shots. What are those shots? They're high doses of antigen that are administered repeatedly to your child. It induces something that as immunologists we call high zone tolerance. High zone tolerance basically amounts to an ability by giving multiple injections at high levels of antigen t o shut down T-cells in an antigen specific fashion.

- Malone clarifies that the T-cell suppression is only against that antigen, and likely does not affect anything else about the immune system but does not claim that there is absolutely 0 broader effect.

> The other things is that these are multiple jabs that are mismatched for the current circulating virus. That's akin to repeatedly taking a flu vaccine from two seasons ago and hoping that it's going to protect against this flu.

- Malone was infected twice 4 months after taking 2 jabs of moderna, infected with both the original Wuhan strain and Delta

> The window of efficacy seems to keep shrinking (effectiveness of the vaccine)

> There is signs in some data, from Denmark, of negative efficacy against Omicron as a function of the number of vaccinations up to 3. Positive efficacy meaning it protects you. Negative efficacy meaning your probability is higher if you've taken the vaccine. It's compared to unvaccinated. It seems to be somewhat higher if you've had 1 jab, even worse if you've had 2, even more likely to get infected if you've had 3 injections.

- Malone describes an anecdote to show how someone who is vaccinated is more likely to participate in dangerous behavior, behaviors with increased likelihood of infection like clubbing and going out, because they feel protected by the vaccine. He says this to say that it may not be the vaccine itself causing the increase in infection, but the resulting behaviors, which are variables unaccounted for. The FDA did not force any pharmaceutical company to collect this data even though they should have.

- Malone goes on to say there are studies out and coming out now about the correlation between jabs and increase in infectivity. The data came from the Netherlands, likely their government. The statisticians are debating how to interpret the data because of how contaminated the original data is, regarding the numerator (total infections).

Joe: So would the assumption be that there's something that's happening to people that are vaccinated where it makes them more susceptible to this particular strain of Covid is a vaccine escape variant?

> So now what you're doing is trying to impose a hypothesis. Which is good! And one of many possible hypotheses. So in a world, a proper world where we are allowed to debate these things, and do these kinds of studies, and examine these kinds of variables without being [draws finger across his neck] in social media, we'd have a very active discussion about this hypothesis and many others. That's my way of not answering your question.

> What we're doing with administering mismatched vaccine, we're driving the effector in memory cells, B and T, towards a population that is focused on a virus that no longer exists. In immune response you don't get everything.

> You didn't ask the question but I'm gonna answer it anyhow: What are your hypotheses for the poor durability of the vaccines?
> My answer is: it looks to me like original antigenic sin. Well that's kind of a cool terminology. What that means, let's unpack original antigenic sin, and what I think could be happening with these data, following your hypotheses you just shared, consistent with that, is that we're driving the immune response towards an antigen, the receptor binding domain of spike, that no longer exists with Omicron. It was initially denied, but it has become clear that all of us have a background immune response against beta coronaviruses. These are naturally circulating cold coronaviruses that have significant immunologic cross-reactivity with SARS COVI-2. And the problem with that, and original antigenic sin, is that those existing memory cells will dominate the immune response when you get infected and when you get vaccinated.

> Now let me unpack that in a way that makes sense for the common person. [...] The sum of your life experiences biases how you respond to - take you for example, in your martial arts, you must know this. What you've experienced in the past in prior fights is gonna bias how you respond to a new opponent. Same happens with your immune system. [...] The prior exposure of your immune system to an antigen that is closely related to a new antigen [biases your immune system as if it were the responding to the old one].

> It could very well be, that the further you're taking jabs, the further you're skewing your immune response in a way that's dysfunctional for infection to Omicron compared to someone who is immunologically na√Øve.

- Prior strains of Covid infected the deep lung. As the new strains are developing, it appears they are settling more in the throat instead. While it has a higher rate of infectivity, it is less pathogenic.

- The CDC modelling data suggested that by now all covid cases would be around 70-80% Omircon, which is now understood to be erroneous modelling.

- WHO asserts that there are no deaths associated with Omicron in the world at this moment. The mortality of Omicron is remarkably low. The official symptoms list for Omicron is pretty much identical to the common cold. It is a mild variant and is able to escape prior vaccination, typically because of a mismatched vaccine.

- The reproductive coefficient of the original Wuhan strain was about 2 to 3. Meaning on average, one would infect 2 to 3 other people if they have the virus themselves. Delta had a coefficient of 5 to 6. Omircon is about 7-10. That's measles territory.

> What that means is, we're all going to get infected, regardless of mask usage or social distancing.

> Our government is out of control on this. They are lawless. They completely disregard bioethics. They completely disregard the federal common rule. They've broken all the rules that I know of that I've been trained on for years and years and years. These mandates of an experimental vaccine are explicitly illegal. They are completely inconsistent with the Nuremberg Code. They are completely inconsistent with the Belmont Report. They are flat out illegal and they don't care. And the only thing standing in between us, and it's too late for many of our colleagues, including my unfortunate colleagues in the DOD (federal employee mandates). Hopefully we're going to be able to stop them before they take our kids.

- Most of the press statements on Omicron infectivity is based on modeled data, not real data, but it is shown as if it were real.

- The hospitalizations due to Covid appear to be dominantly Delta, not Omicron.

sejsm9,"I've been listening to the Witcher lorecast on Spotify which goes into quite a bit of detail about the history of the other witcher schools, apart from the Wolves- the Griffins, Cats, Bears, Vipers, and briefly the Cranes and Manticores. I'm not sure exactly where they source their lore from, but if I had to pick I'd go with the school of the Griffins.

I'd pick the Griffins bc Erland of Larvik modelled the school after himself, and he's the closest thing in the Witcher universe to a classic knightly archetype. As one of the original young boys experimented on to be one of the first Witchers, Erland experienced a great deal of suffering over the course of his lifetime, relentlessly. He went through a great a deal of physical agony and lost most of his relationships. What sets him apart, however, from other witchers who went through similar experiences is his response to it- he decides to give his suffering meaning by deciding that he went through it for a purpose, which is monster hunting. 

His school is therefore almost monastic in its aim, with a higher, partly religious orientation. The podcast also talks about how the Griffins were the most respected of the Witcher schools in their heyday bc of their knightly code of conduct and the respect with which they treated people. Erland  even went as far as trying to get the various states of the Continent to sponsor his school so that they could provide their services for free to even the poorest person bothered by monsters. I love the idea of a socialist witcher lmfao. But yes, in addition to this stuff I think he mightve been against slaughtering sapient monsters as well, much like Geralt. In any case, he doesn't have a happy ending, with all his efforts ultimately crashing down around him and the school of the Griffin being brought down by the mages, but I think his story of trying to find purpose in helping other people through his skillset, acquired through great suffering, is something that really attracts me.

also incidentally the school of the vipers was solely formed to kill off the wild hunt they're my second pick haha i think that's quite badass.",Which Witcher school would you pick if you were in the universe? And why?,2.0,2.0

Australia won by 146 runs

**Pat Cummins** ""It's pretty crazy. Even as a professional cricketer these are the series you have in your diary a couple of years out. To be at the end of a five-Test series with so many positives - winning 4-0 - it's huge so really pumped. I'm really happy as a captain, not sure Nathan Lyon agrees with me...think that's been a highlight, not only the 11 guys playing but we've had about 15 players used and some really tough calls to leave out high quality players. Really feels like we are building to something big. To have someone like Cameron Green in his second year to grow as a batter and bowler as well as some of the younger players then the hold stalwarts like Scotty Boland and all the old-pros continue their form. Can't wait to show our wares overseas, we really judge ourselves in all conditions.""

**Joe Root** ""It's been a really tough tour. We've played good cricket in parts, just not been able to structure a whole game together. It's something we have to learn from and not go away and keep making the same mistakes. It's pretty obvious we need to be putting more runs on the board. Too often we've not given our bowlers enough to work. We've been outplayed in all areas and credit to Australia.""

**Sampath Bandarupalli** has a couple of stats for you:

**1312** - <a href=""https://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=1;filter=advanced;groupby=match;orderby=balls;orderbyad=reverse;qualmin1=40;qualval1=wickets;size=200;spanmin1=01+Jan+1910;spanval1=span;template=results;type=team"">Sixth shortest Test match in terms of balls</a> since 1910 where all 40 wickets fell.

8th Test defeat for Joe Root in Australia as captain. Equals Brian Lara's 8 defeats in South Africa - the record for <a href=""https://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=1;filter=advanced;groupby=captains;groupby=host;home_or_away=2;home_or_away=3;orderby=lost;template=results;type=team"">most defeats as a visiting skipper in a country</a>.

**Ricky Ponting on Channel 7:** ""On performance there's absolutely no way that Justin Langer cannot continue on as head coach of this Australian cricket team.""

rueny8,"Waited in queue for 30 mins (50k people) to get in the game, get logged in, literally buy three things off the flea market and the third buy I got the backend error that forces a game close. 

Queue is now up to 70000. This game is currently more annoying and less fun to even try to get playing than fucking Star Citizen, and that's really saying something. 

Yes, I know Nikita insists this isn't due to twitch drops and I'm calling fat bullshit on that, the servers were never in this sorry state on wipe day, or the weekends after wipe. The only times I remember the servers for this game being at absolute worst are when twitch events are going. 

Calling it right now, game will be fine when the twitch events end.


EDIT-it's official. I logged into Star Citizen, updated a patch, created a character (have to do this every major patch) ,went to the space port, grabbed my ship, cleared orbit and flew to a moon, mined a rock worth about 400k (a new fancy ship is about 2 mil), flew it back to the refinery, landed, and refined it, in less time than it takes me to log into EFT. EFT timer now at 14000. This game is now less playable than star citizen which is hilariously sad because star citizen is game where nothing gets done quickly.

Double edit - got in game, played a raid, game froze after raid trying to sell something on flea. Probanly going to have to alt F4 and sit through queue again or go back to star citizen lmao.

Edit-yup, had to alt F4. 125k people in queue. Back to star citizen I go.",This is the worst state I've ever seen this game.,2.0,2.0

Obvious the touristy obligations are there like any city, but I guess what I'm asking is:

What do **you**, as locals, recommend for someone with limited time.

I don't care if it's super bagel bacon Wednesdays or Sunday 'elephants day at the zoo'.

I did London for 7 years, and have done enough Paris to know it's a bit..shit, so I'm not looking for optimist first-timer stuff.. I'm just curious:

s4v8fi,"TLDR: My (21M) girlfriend (22F) of three years and friend of six, made out with a guy at her job two days before Christmas, I found out on Christmas night while she was drunk at home. She told me she felt a connection with him, and during our brief separation she slept with him. He now wants nothing to do with her. Im trying to fix this with her, but I feel alone and cant stop thinking Im an option and a complete tool. All Ive ever wanted is for her to be happy.

So like the TLDR says, she met this guy at her job. Just before Christmas she made out with him at the job, and didnt tell me. On christmas night, I came home and she was incredibly drunk. So drunk that she began throwing up everywhere, which is not like her to even drink much less get destroyed. When I went to find some clothes in the next room I saw her phone was open on this coworkers chat. Ive never checked her phone, Ive never had to. But I saw a message from her asking this dude if he was still awake with a heart. My curiosity got the best of me and I looked. They exchanged very intimate text messages. They talked about how the kissed, how he was the best kisser shes ever kissed, how tension was good and it was the baddest thing theyve ever done.. I was heartbroken. I watched my life fall apart in 10 seconds. I gathered some stuff after making sure she was okay, and stayed at my parents for a few days. During that time, she tried to get me to come home. She stated she had a connection with the guy and that they felt compatible, and didn't know why. I didnt come home until yesterday, and found out she slept with him while we were seperated.. She said she didnt think she could fix it with me and she felt alone and scared. I found out she said she wanted a relationship with him, and he said he didnt want one with her and had become distant. They had been talking the entire time we seperated even though she said she wasnt talking to him outside of work and that they both feel bad.. I looked at the messages from the entire time I was gone and was sick to my stomach.. She said he was the best shes ever had, said she wanted something with him and that her and I were done.. She talked about how she wanted to do things to him to give him pleasure..shes never been that kind of person. My girlfriend is saying she wanted to fix things with me the entire time, and said shes willing to do anything to fix it. She left that job, started a new one, and blocked the guy on everything. I feel like a choice, I feel like Ill never forget what happened. I feel like she wants something else, not me. The messages they exchanged were so intimate..some of the things she said to him and did to him we havent even done. Ive cried nonstop for three weeks. Im now home trying to fix things, she wants to go to counseling, I just cant help but think about everything nonstop.

I dont want to give up what weve build, but I cant look at her the same. I feel so self conscious. Shes since told me that she was lying to him to make him feel good but I just cant believe it. I just want what he had back. Im terrified and have no idea what to do. I love her so much. Ive never felt so strongly about anyone but I feel like nothing is sacred in our relationship anymore.

It sucks even more when you realize just how long their engagement was, meaning he couldn't find the courage to tell her the truth during that whole year. Telling her about it on the wedding day not only taints it but gives her no space to process it.

So in the end, my personal take on this is that if he couldn't make the confession less stressful *for her*, then he should have kept it to himself. It was indeed just a kiss and he knew that chances are Penny is not going to break up with him over that. So I think it would have been kinder if he never told her.

Most of the posts here seem to not understand what feminism is.

This sub is called anti-feminists, but the content that is pushed is anti-women-taking-advantage-of-men, which I don't think anyone disapproves of. 

Feminism is a movement to reduce and ultimately remove our society's built-in mechanisms to provide less opportunities to women. It's important to note that this is not meant to be ""at the cost of reducing rights of others"" - feminism only sets out to level the playing field to give everyone a fair chance.

Mood spoiler: >!Its a big bummer!<

As the title says, I recently settled a custody dispute regarding my 7 y/o child. The order states that my child will spend the night at my residence this upcoming Saturday. It does not state anything about his mother being able to enter my residence at any time, nor does it allow for verbal communication without express written consent.

To be clear, I completely understand a mother's desire to see where her child will be staying, especially when our child has not spent a night with me in over 4 years. However, the only reason she's allowing it now is because after two rounds of mediation, an ADR hearing, and upon completion of the discovery process, it became abundantly clear that I was going to get more or less everything I was asking for in my proposed parenting plan.

She attempted to negotiate an ability to enter my residence into the settlement, but due to her behavior throughout the process, my attorney specifically advised me to not allow her to enter my residence. She has a documented history of misrepresenting facts and presenting false allegations.

Now with my first overnight coming up, she and her husband are texting me, each separately and in a combined group thread, stating that I'm crazy for not letting them in and that it's their right, blah blah blah. I have made them aware that I do not consent to them entering my residence and I know that I'm under no obligation to grant them this request. I'm also aware that if they decide that my child can't spend the night with me that my ex is in contempt.

When they made it clear that they would attempt to enter my residence, I insisted on picking him up from their residence, but they are firm on transporting him here.

What is the absolute best thing that I can do in this situation? Can I hire an off-duty cop to supervise the transition? Should I ask a friend who my ex is familiar with if he can be present to witness the transition?

If I'm being completely unreasonable I'll take those opinions too, but I'm not letting these people into my house.

Edit: Wow, this blew up. Thank you to everyone who offered advice and voiced support. I‚Äôll be contacting my city‚Äôs non-emergency line today to request an escort and/or info regarding neutral drop off locations. Will update if anything particularly exciting happens!

[UPDATE](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/rz8d88/update_recently_settled_a_custody_dispute_and/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

[UPDATE] Recently settled a custody dispute and finally have my first overnight. Ex and her husband insist on entering my residence and I insist that they not. What can I do?

Link to Original Post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/rx3mx7/usa\_recently\_settled\_a\_custody\_dispute\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/rx3mx7/usa_recently_settled_a_custody_dispute_and/)

This is a bit of a lengthy update; it's still very fresh in my mind so I will try to keep useless details to a minimum. TL;DR of the original post is, my ex wife has a documented history of misrepresenting facts and presenting false allegations with regard to my personal well-being and living conditions. After going through court we settled for basically everything that I wanted, and today was supposed to be the first custody exchange. The TL;DR for this update can be found down below.

I called my city's non-emergency line on Thursday to inquire about civil standbys. The operator gave me some great information, and I got really confident that all would go according to plan.

I also contacted a friend who my ex knows and has a neutral-positive rapport with, and he came by for moral support and to be a third-party witness to the whole ordeal. Side note, my God, I am so happy that I have this guy in my life because he was the absolute perfect person to have with me for the whole ordeal. If you're seeing this man -- thank you again.

This morning ahead of the exchange I called my city's non-emergency line back as instructed, and they dispatched officers to my residence. When they arrived, they informed me that because there is no order for supervised exchanges or a peace/protective order in place, they were not going to be able to provide service as requested. Big fucking bummer, but not the end of the world.

My buddy showed up, I brought him inside and showed him around the place (since my ex knows him I hoped he may be able to vouch for my living conditions), and we prepared for their arrival. They showed up a little bit later, I got my phone out, started a video, put my phone in my breast pocket, and we went outside on the sidewalk to attempt the exchange.

Essentially what happened is I reiterated my stance: They were not welcome inside, and I would be taking our child inside per the agreement that we both signed and that was signed by a judge. My ex and her husband immediately began raising their voices (with my child being held by his mother outside in sub-freezing temperatures) and insisting that they needed to get our child inside because it was so cold out, and they would be coming with him. As I stood firm and calmly/repeatedly reminded them that I had no obligation to let them inside and that it would not be happening, they began making threats to call CPS because I was ""leaving our child out in the cold""; that they ""smelled drugs,"" and then my ex accused me of looking hungover (which is ridiculous considering everyone is well aware that I've been sober for over 2 years).

Anyway, you get the gist -- it didn't go well. It was also a very public dispute, and because of the continuously raised voices on the part of my ex and her husband, someone in the neighborhood called the cops. Before they arrived, my ex and her husband threatened to call them as well, which I encouraged, and as soon as they went back to their car to do so, the police that someone else had called showed up.

Essentially the officers informed both of us that they could not force the child to enter my residence without his mom, but that I was fully within my right to deny her entry and that if she chose to leave with our child, she would be in violation of the court order (which I had printed and brought with me), and they would be writing that into their incident report. They encouraged her to call her lawyer which I believe she attempted but was unsuccessful in doing. She came back claiming that her lawyer stated that, ""If the minor child doesn't wish to enter the residence without her, then she would not be found in contempt of the order."" Literally everybody present knew that that was false and told her that, but she refused to believe it. She then made threats to get $30,000 -- no, *$100,000* \-- from her father to take me back to court.

The officers repeatedly informed my ex that she had two options: Drop the kid off, or violate the order. They encouraged her to pick. I asked if she would feel more comfortable if an officer entered my residence to attest to my living conditions, she thought about it for a minute, but did not budge. Her way or the highway.

By this time it had been over an hour of argument, we hadn't gotten anywhere, the police had another more urgent call, and their involvement was proving futile. My ex agreed to go back to her vehicle and ""attempt to encourage our child to go inside"" (I firmly believed the opposite was going on). After 20 minutes she informed me that he did not want to go inside unless she could join him. I asked if I could speak to him directly, which she allowed, and I very calmly let him know how sorry I was that this was happening this way, that I know we had both been very excited for this day for a long time, and that I hoped we would still be able to have our fun day together. I asked if he also hoped we could still have a fun day together, and he said yes. So I asked him if he felt comfortable coming inside, and he said yes, at which point both his mother and step-father turned around and said, ""But you're not comfortable unless mommy comes with you, right?"" He hesitated, they both shook their heads to coach him, and he shook his head. They took that as proof that my ex was not in contempt and that we would ""have to reschedule,"" and then drove off.

Police returned as this was happening and asked if I  would like to leave a domestic victim statement, which I did. They gave me my copy, handed me a card with info necessary to retrieve the police report, gave me a little bit of a pep talk, and went on their way.

I'm devastated -- absolutely heartbroken. I've been looking forward to this day for years; it finally came, and my ex just couldn't face the music and live a life where she doesn't have complete control over mine.

I know that I handled this the right way and that I now have a slam dunk case for contempt. I hate that this has to be so difficult. To anyone going through anything similar, you're not alone -- this sucks, but we got this. Keep fighting for them kids, y'all.

\----------

**TL;DR:** In the end, police involvement did not stop my ex or her husband from insisting that they had every right to enter my residence. In the process, they convinced themselves that the order ""was an agreement between us, not something ordered by a judge,"" even with police telling them directly that if they left, my ex would in fact be in violation of the order, and that it would be documented in an official police report. I still don't get an overnight with my kid, but I have a slam dunk contempt case and my kid knows I'm not the crazy one.

sdjms3,"I took a sick day yesterday due to getting hammered by covid booster side effects. I could barely walk let alone make a phone call (and didn't want to call at 6am anyway) so I sent a text. Today I get into work to find an email from the guy who does the rosters stating that texting is unacceptable. Is there a law around whether you have to call in sick? I tried googling but there's zero results about this. The way I see it is that a text at 6am is far better than a call at a more ""reasonable"" time. 6am text gives far more warning than a call. I also don't see how a text is bad if you legitimately cannot bring yourself to talk on the phone. 

I'll be speaking to fair work about this for some advice but I won't be able to call them until tomorrow. Just wondering if anyone knows the laws around this in the meantime :)

Edit: I'm in QLD. There is no policy about preferred method of communication, I have checked several times. The guy who does the rosters is not my superior he is the same level as me, we were hired at the same time. He hasn't mentioned his preferred method of contact until now. I just wanted to know what my rights are as an employee when it comes to something like this.

Also we have no HR department. I work for an incredibly small business (we have about 12 employees total including management).

2nd edit: I'm getting a lot of hate over the debate whether to call or text/email a sick day. This was not my original question although I worded it badly. Let me rephrase it. What I originally wanted to know was who *enforced* the method of communication used for taking a sick day. As many people have mentioned, it's not a legal matter, rather it is a company policy. This has answered my question. 

Further info, my company does *not* have a policy about this, not only have I checked every single policy (there isn't many), I have also checked my contract and it's not there, however I asked a manager who confirmed we did not have one. I want to make it clear that I do not mind the method of communication preferred, however I do think it's unprofessional for a business to not have this outlined ANYWHERE! Again I repeat **the method of communication that is preferred for calling in sick is not the issue nor is it the original question**.",Is there laws around whether you call or text in sick to work?,2.0,2.0

Through a clear dedication to the Halo, The Act Man has shown amazing attention to detail, story, and environments presented within Halo. First, The Act Man is a video game reviewer and halo enthusiast, who has garnered 1.28 million subscribers on youtube grossing an amazing 252 million views. He has started with halo seen in many Halo 5 clips from 2015, since then he has grown in quality of content and understanding of the importance of halo. Though a few times his critiques of Halo have led to possible shadow banning of important early access for a person that loves this game so much. These critiques have never been done with foul intent but with the intent of pure constructive criticism for a game he loves. Understanding this we can look state the current state of Halo and his role within the community. Halo Infinite has been one of the best halo games released within the decade and 343 needs proper prase for this but there is still room for improvement. This is keenly understood by The Act Man who has laid out proper critique and methods of improvement for the Halo franchise to come. This can be seen in both his road map to improve the multiplayer experience and his hour-long review of Halo Infinite; both of these presentations present his understanding of what the soul of Halo is. As a member of the Halo community, I feel that he has voiced my concerns and hopes for the game perfectly but see it should have a larger impact on the development process. He seems to feel this way as well, I truly hope that this petition can allow him to gain some input into the development of Halo on a formal scale with 343 industries. As he states he is only 10 minutes away, let's make use of this for the benefit of our beloved Halo.

Basically I hurt my shoulder a week ago and decided to get a massage. I'd never gotten one before so I looked up a random place, got an erection and the masseuse offered to give me a happy ending for an extra $50 which led to one of the most intense orgasms of my life. I didn't know it was that kind of place and I felt super guilty.

I had been debating on whether or not to go back because I haven't been with a woman in about a year and it felt super good and honestly isn't unaffordable to me. I made an appointment and when they asked if I wanted a specific masseuse I requested the woman who massaged me before.

I went there yesterday. When she came into the room and saw me she said it was nice to see me again and asked if I wanted the same massage as last time. I nodded and said, ""Yes please."" Then I got the same massage as last time. She commented afterwards that I should probably get this kind of massage at least once a week as it appears that I need it.

I'm honestly inclined to agree at this point. It wasn't as awkward as last time and it seems like she enjoyed herself and offered more specialized services for an additional yet not unreasonable fee.

I'm probably going to go again soon.",Update: I went back to the happy ending massage place. I couldn't help myself.,2.0,2.0

seslmz,"Ladies and gentlemen, I'd planned to speak to you tonight to report on the state of the S&P500, which is in absolute shambles, but the events of the past several months have led me to change those plans. Today is a day for mourning and remembering.

u/HellzAngelz and I are entertained to the core by the tragedy of the rocketship GME. We know we share this joy with all of the people of subreddit. This is truly a global shitshow.

Twelve months ago, almost to the day, we gained millions of subscribers on a brilliant mission to the moon. But we've never lost our shirts in unison like this; we've never collectively gotten crushed like this. And perhaps we've forgotten the courage it took for the holders of the stock; but they, the retarded apes, were aware of the dangers, but bought shares and DRS'd them anyways. We mourn the losses millions of retards who bought high and sold low along the way.

For the families of the apes, we cannot bear, as you do, the full impact of the knowledge that apes are retarded. But we feel their stupidity, and we're thinking about you so very much. Your loved ones were daring and brave, and they had that special grace, that special spirit that says, ""Give me a stock, and I'll tell all my friends to buy it."" They had a hunger to explore the markets and discover its frauds. They wished to destroy the hedgies, and they did. They destroyed Citron.

We've grown tired of the conspiracy theories on this stock. It's hard to entertain us. But for 10 years this Monday, wallstreetbets shitposting has been doing just that. We've grown used to the idea of high quality shitposts, and perhaps we forget that we've only just begun. We're 11.5 million shitposters strong.

And I want to say something to the paint eaters of SuperStonk who are holding onto the stock for dear life. I know it is hard to understand, but sometimes other stocks exist on the market. It's all a part of having an economy with more than one company in it. It's all part of having a place for discussion that isn't a cultlike echochamber shouting the same thing over and over. The riches of the market don't belong to those who invest without doing their own research; it belongs to the DD posters who can defend their thesis against derision with verifiable facts. DeepFuckingValue and his detailed DDs was pulling us into riches, and we'll continue to do quality research that would make him proud.

I've always had great faith and respect for our DD posters, and what happened with the nonstop ""squeeze DD"" trash that followed GME does nothing to diminish it. We don't hide our losses. We don't delete our incorrect DDs after the fact. We review them publicly and learn from them. That's the way high quality discussion happens, and we wouldn't change it for a minute.

We'll continue our quest for tendies. There will be more hilarious shitposts and god tier DD, and, yes, more dumb memes that people upvote for god knows why. Nothing ends once you're bankrupt; there's always someone willing to lend you money.

I want to add that I wish I could talk to every bear who posts on WSB or who submitted a trash tier meme and tell them: ""Your dedication and steadfastedness have moved and impressed us for years. Although we don't understand the nature of your brain damage, we want you to know, stocks only go up.""

There's a coincidence today. On this day 36 years ago, the great explorer Michael Smith/Scott flew the spaceship Challenger. In his lifetime the great barriers to making gains were $45 commissions for trading, and a CNBC analyst later said, ""They got their stock tips from their friends at the pub, which was a lot worse than randomly guessing."" Well, today we can say of the WSB crew: Their willingness to believe in random strangers on the internet was equally ill advised.

The apes of the moon mission GameStop and others honored us by the manner in which they shit all over the subreddit. We will never forget them, mostly because they will probably stick around for years, telling us of their journey, and wishing us losses as we continue to bet everything on companies with zero revenue and huge losses.

A couple years ago I[28F] (23/24 at the time) worked a pretty high-stress job in the ER, and I was privy to picking up a lot of overtime. I don‚Äôt have kids, never plan to, and was living alone and just trying to save money for life.
Anyway, I complained about something mundane (I think about being tired as I was a hardcore night shifter) but nonetheless something that illicited the response from my child having friend ‚Äúwell, I have kids, so how do you think I feel?!‚Äù Which I responded to with a smile ‚Äúwell, I chose to keep my legs shut, so that‚Äôs not my fault‚Äù 

Obviously we can all have sex to enjoy and not reproduce, but seriously. The look on her face was PRICELESS. And she chose to have kids.

Then on another level heading toward the deck he did it again, but I decided to step aside and let him through first, he then saw I was going up another level and started chase again like he thought he was going to miss out on something. 

Then another guy did it as well while getting a drink, same arm to arm action but I didn't move again either and the guy audibly started grunting and scoffing. The guys were over 6 foot so maybe they didn't me down there but the lady looked dead in the eye while she slid infront of me.

We would co parent as much as possible and will be going to school there for the first time next week. 
 I am taking her to court now because she now changed her own proposal wich results in me seeing my son only 1.5 day per week (was 3,5 days) and she won't allow me to pick him up after school. (And i don't want to go there because she will cause a scene with our son present) Her only reason for doing this is that I would be bad for his structure and that wouldn't be in his best interest.

When I bring up monogamy, he agrees it's what he wants, but then says he ""doesn't like being confined in general, and being told what I can and can't do makes me want to break rules"". I feel quite the opposite, I like my man telling me to not fuck around and things like that. I know he's a good guy, but I find his responses so frustrating. I just want him to look me in the eyes and say things like ill never cheat or hurt you, you're the only one for me and things like that.

Personally, I cannot fucking stand it, I don‚Äôt give a fuck who says it, if there‚Äôs malicious/spiteful/sexist intents behind it, you‚Äôre on my hit list. Like in one story I read, the MC would get slut-shamed constantly and you‚Äôd lose points if you wanted to kiss your BOYFRIEND. NO. JOKE.

scyjh4,"TL;DR. - My new coworker is on OnlyFans and I‚Äôve had her make custom videos for me, rated my dick and bought her some lingerie from an amazon wishlist (via an OF tip) and have to decide to have her send it to me now that she wore it and came in it.

I‚Äôm a piece of shit, I understand that.  I started a new job six months ago. It‚Äôs the kind of job where I‚Äôm paired up with other people covering a sales territory.  I‚Äôm a grizzled vet of this kind of job, but one of the women I‚Äôm paired up with is only in her 2nd year and only 3 years out of college. 

Let‚Äôs call her Sammi.  Sammi is in her mid-20s, quite tall, probably 5‚Äô 10‚Äù (I‚Äôm 6‚Äô 1‚Äù and in most heels she's at or just below my eye line).  Her tits are nice and firm, but on her long frame they look small, despite being C cups.  Her legs and ass are both incredible.  Her face is nice, though not cover-model attractive and she‚Äôs very good at doing her makeup.  Her eyes are hazel, and she has a big, wide tooth filled smile.  She‚Äôs very fit, and played volleyball in college.

When we met, I obviously noticed that she was attractive.  It‚Äôs common enough in this industry that this isn‚Äôt the first very attractive woman I‚Äôve been paired up with.  Basically, you use a young hottie to open the doors and get meetings with the middle aged men who are in middle management, and then I come in and deliver the technical pitch to actually get the deal done. 

So, anyways, I started with this company, and early on her and I had to do a fair amount of travel together (this was over summer when COVID wasn‚Äôt as spooky).  We got to know each other during those trips since many hours of driving and many shared meals is part of the gig. 

There‚Äôs a lot of room to be a de-gen when you‚Äôre on the road like we are.  Sammi impressed me by consistently avoiding staying out too late, drinking too much, or over indulging, which is easy in this line of work.

So how did I find her secret identity?  Well, we were in a nice-ish hotel together in a big metro, and by accident we both were in the workout room at the same time.  Nothing uncouth happened, but I did, obviously, see her in a sports bra and gymshark bottoms.  That‚Äôs also when I saw that she had a fairly unique tattoo on her shoulder. Seeing her like that, I really understood just how I‚Äôm shape and attractive her body is.

She did a good job of dressing professionally,  not overly slutty.  Same with her makeup and hair.  That said, it‚Äôs not like I wasn‚Äôt aware that she was attractive.  It‚Äôs worth noting she is about 15 years younger than I am, and when we met she had an engagement ring on her left hand.  Other than appreciating working with someone smart and attractive, I kept things very professional (and still do).

But how does that translate to OF? Well, I‚Äôm a piece of shit, I found her personal IG account and proceeded to jerk off to the various pics of her in bikinis and festival garb. Digging through it saw that she had likes from a NSFW OF poster I also followed (on both OF and IG).  I already knew that OF poster was local to my region, and when I pulled up the NSFW OF creator‚Äôs feed, I scrolled back in time and a few years back there were photos of her and Sammi, but Sammi was tagged to a different, private IG account.  I googled the IG account name, and it came back with an OF account.

I decided to pay the $10 for access to that OF account, and BOOM, there‚Äôs Sammi, shoving a 8‚Äù neon green dildo up her pussy with a jeweled buttplug in.  I dug out my flashlight and came so hard to those vids, it‚Äôs not even funny. 

After I blew my loads, I scrolled through her OF feed and recognized a ton of the hotel rooms we‚Äôd stayed in. She had a good number of photos of her flashing in hot tubs or while working out. There was one photo in particular, in which she took a video of her inserting a plug in her ass, then the outfit she was wearing‚Ä¶I remembered the day of the meeting and her wearing that skirt.  Kudos to hear, she never seemed the slightest distracted.

Cruising through her OF feed, I learned her page is only a few months old, and she is in the top 4%.  Her posts usually get 8-10 likes.  Her first post discussed recently splitting with her fiance, but she still wears the ring all the time, so I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs up there. She doesn‚Äôt ever talk about him.  Almost all of her content is filmed in hotel rooms, and she never shows her face, and has never gone live.

One of her ‚Äúbenefits‚Äù for subbing is a free cock rating.  I got a little buzzed one night, and decided to take advantage of it. She gave me a 9/10, and said my girth ‚Äúscared‚Äù her.  I‚Äôm not super long, a hair over 6‚Äù, but I‚Äôm nearly 6‚Äù in circumference (yes I measured).  Why do I know this?  Because I‚Äôve had a few women comment or complain that my diameter is too big and it‚Äôs hard to take or blow me.  I had one girl in college who I wound up dumping because my size was just too much for her so she barely wanted to do anything physical, plus she was uptight as all hell.  

I also spent $$$ and had her record a 10 minute custom video. It‚Äôs her dancing and playing with herself in some nice lingerie I gifted her, and then rubbing herself off through the panties, and eventually taking them off and finishing herself off with a vibrator.  The audio is hot AF and  it‚Äôs very clearly Sammi.  If I want, I get to have her send me the panties.  I don‚Äôt particularily care about womens used underwear, so there‚Äôs no real sexual thrill getting them, but there is something sort of exciting about having them knowing that she doesn‚Äôt know I‚Äôm the one who bought them.

So yeah, I‚Äôm a creepy internet stalker.  Obviously, I can‚Äôt tell her about any of this.  The dynamic is such that if she‚Äôs at all made uncomfortable by me knowing she‚Äôs on OF, a platform in which she doesn‚Äôt reveal her identity, then there‚Äôs just no way for us to work together long term.  I‚Äôm not supposed to know it‚Äôs her, and it‚Äôs obvious she wants to keep this aspect of her life separate from her professional life.  I will respect that and once my sub runs out, let it lapse, and likely nuke my OF account just to be safe.  

She has enough shit to deal with in this industry and career.  She‚Äôs good at her job, and a pleasure to work with, and I don‚Äôt want to fuck up our working relationship or make it harder for her to be successful.  So, no, I won‚Äôt be having her send me her used panties‚Ä¶I‚Äôll just jerk off to the video‚Äôs I ripped of her dancing, stripping and fucking herself :)

As someone who's only really played the hell out of two Mario titles which being 7 and 8, the roster's just not good. I would've loved to seen someone like Blooper or Hammer Bro taking on some of the minigames in Superstars. And I wonder, did they trim the roster so it could be nostalgic in a way? As in making the roster almost as small as the way older titles? Idk, I just really would've preferred having 7's roster or 8's roster in Superstars because those rosters were just the best imo (and yes I have seen every roster in each game).",Is there a reason as to why the Superstars roster isn't really that good?,2.0,2.0

sel67w,"So I live in the middle of the liberal cesspool of commiefornia, but here in the center of the state its super conservative and all farm land and mountains. I stopped at a gas station that I've been going to occasionally for 20 years, and in the last 2 years have never worn a mask inside. Not once.
Tonight I went inside and I was stopped and told I needed to put on a mask, so I said no its ok I'm exempt. Which is what I say everywhere else and it worked every time. But this time at this particular shell station the clerk started yelling at me and demanding I put one on. So I walk to the fridge and grab some waters for my kids in the car and walk up to the register. She takes the water and puts it behind the counter and refuses to sell it to me unless I put on a mask. The following conversation ensued 
Me: no, why should I
Clerk: BECAUSE IT'S A MANDATE AND YOU HAVE TO.
Me: no I don't, the mandate was overturned last week, there is no mandate.
Clerk: IT'S THE LAW YOU HAVE TO 
Me: no its not, there is no law, there is no mandate. 
Clerk: I KNOW YOU HAVE YOUR BELIEFS, BUT YOU HAVE TO .
Me: what beliefs? There's nothing in effect that says anyone has to where a mask anywhere.  Even state workers don't wear them.
Clerk: YOU NEED TO PUT ON A MASK OR GET OUT OF THE STORE.
me: why? And I could have been gone awhile ago if you'd behaved and sold me my waters.
clerk: GET OUT OR PUT ON A MASK
me: no, I need the waters
Clerk: (calls her manager for advise) MY BOSS IS GOING TO CALL THE SHERIFF 
me: good, I'd like to report harassment and discrimination.  Also I want the phone number of your manager and her boss
Clerk: YOU CANT HAVE THAT 
me: bullshit, I want to speak to the manager (yeah I know Karen lol) 
Clerk: NO YOU CANT
me : bullshit, any customer demanding the manage shall be granted a manager or their phone number.
Clerk: FINE (puts her manager on speaker phone)
Manager: YOU ARE GOING TO GET OUT OF THE STORE OR IM CALLING THE SHERIFF. 
me : I thought you already did, I'm getting tired of waiting for him
manager: ( bunch of other incoherent screaming on speaker phone)
Me: I would have been gone along time ago if you people could act decent and do your job and Selle my waters.
Manager: (more screaching and claiming I was rude and harassing the clerk)
Me to the clerk: was I rude or did I yell at you or act ridiculously?
Clerk: NO
Me to the manager: see you're the rude one. Not me. Now give me the number to your boss.
Manager: (screams numbers out)
Clerk just starts ringing up my waters. I tell her I also need 20 on pump 4,  ( just enough to get home, wasn't gonna fill up ($140) there after that)

rvbgwy,,Treated myself to my first LV ‚ò∫Ô∏è,,
rtsjgc,"    I used to own 6 guitars. 1 acoustic, 1 acoustic electric, 1 acoustic  bass (just for gits and shiggles) and 3 electrics. Gibson, Epiphone, Fender, and my very first guitar ever - a $50 First Act starter bundle (ncluding an amp, so the guitar was probably worth about $20 in mint condition). I cherished these guitars. I regularly cleaned them meticulously, oiled the fretboards, they were always hanging on my wall, never so much as a ding, scratch, or even belt buckle rash. The hurricane took them all from me, and I didn't have insurance because all of my money is currently going towards fixing my MANY fuck ups from back when I was in active drug addiction. My dad, bless his heart and may he RIP, died from a massive heart attack last month. Shortly before he died, he bought me a cheap, $100 Fender DG-8 acoustic from a pawn shop (he didn't know anything about guitar quality), but that guitar was my baby. I had it set up by a luthier, filed down the nut and saddle for better action, and did a couple other minor things, but the guitar was doomed from the start, Little did I know, the bracing on the inside had started to fail and the wood braces were splitting. Just a few minutes ago, the worst happened. The neck completely snapped. It's irreparable, unless I want to spend hundreds of dollars, which I don't have, and I won't be able to afford another axe for quite a number of years. I live paycheck to paycheck, and just barely. Playing music was the one thing keeping me sober, and the one thing I had left to remind me of my dad. I don't know what to do, y'all.      
          
    I'm not asking for advice, and I know my only possible option is an impossibility - to buy a new guitar. But I'm broke, and because of my past mistakes, I'll be broke for the foreseeable future. In 5, maybe 6 years, I could afford one, but there's simply no way I'll make it that far. I'm honestly on the verge of relapsing right now over all this, it's just too fucking much, man. I can't handle this. This couldn't have possibly happened at a worse time.     
        
    Anyways, sorry for being a bummer, and thanks to anyone who sat through and read all my whiny baby bullshit. I sincerely hope you all had a wonderful Christmas and an awesome New Years and that y'all got to blow some shit up, light some shit on fire, and most importantly, spend time with family.

But it was the first time he‚Äôd watched her with her friends out, the neighbors gone on vacation. All alone. She‚Äôd been working since morning, moving furniture, clearly planning to paint her room. Just wearing a tshirt that didn‚Äôt even cover her ass. An invitation. He smiled when her saw her earbuds, occasionally dancing to the music as she started painting the walls. She would be deaf to him until it was too late.  
  
He busted the glass door frame, reaching inside, unlocking the door. He walked up on her, young, dumb, blonde. He deserved her, no one else. Already a streak of paint dripped down a cheek as she spun around and froze, seeing him. He was on her in a second, slamming her back into the freshly painted wall, punching her gut. She doubled up immediately, then he grabbed her hair and slammed her face first into the wall, adding some color from her, as she slumped to the floor, barely conscious. You could almost tell it was a face. He kicked her once then picked up the bucket of paint, dumping it all over her body, her face, her chest, then tearing into her. He tore off her t-shirt, sliding her around on the plastic tarp.  
  
He pulled at her hips, spitting only once, before shoving himself into her ass. She screamed, the pain and adrenaline making her focused again. He wanted the struggle. She was coated in purple, just a stream of red from her nose or the pale white of her skin breaking the up the color. He pinned her arms behind her, using his weight to pin her down as he pounded her ass. It was tighter than he even expected, virginal, but he only needed to use it once. She fought she he dashed her head into the floor, adding more red to the purple. Then, when he was close, he punched her hard, tensing then suddenly limp under him. He stood up, found the painters tape, making sure her arms and legs were bound, then searched for and finally found a funnel. He went through a lot of tape, securing it to her mouth and head, finally finishing up with some duck tape.   
  
Then, bound and unable to move, he pissed in the funnel, watching her wake, confused, choking on his bitter piss. She had but one choice, drink or drown and eventually, concussed as she was, she chose to drink. Her eyes pleaded with him, her face almost covered in tape. He blew her a kiss, then picked up the other bucket of paint, opening it, and pouring it in the funnel. He smiled, watching her thrash, watching her make an impossible choice, refilling the funnel again and again, as her struggled weakened, then finally stopped. He‚Äôd never made art before, but it was beautiful he thought, as he left it behind, so that the world might see.",Art - A short violent story,2.0,2.0

As children are being raised, it is taught that girls ALWAYS include a title of respect when addressing any Male, regardless of the age or status of said Male. Boys are taught to expect girls to speak to Them with respect and know to be upset about any errors in their etiquette.

Girls and boys are both sent off to school (separate, gender segregated schools) up until around the age of 13 (math involving converting fractions, etc is taught around 10 to 11 and girls becoming comfortable with that sort of schooling is often helpful when it comes to a baker or cook with a knack for adjusting recipes). At the age of 13, boys will continue on their education paths while the girls are taught newly mandated courses that teach more useful skills for women to know such as cleaning, cooking, serving. As the girls age, these courses eventually include sexual instructional classes. It is expected for women to know how to appear feminine and eye-catching by this time. 

Women are considered property of Men. Whether this be their Father or Husband. The traditional way of asking the Fathers permission for the woman returns; with the Ownership of women, comes all the rights todays pet owner has. Chips for tracking, collars and leashes, name changing, spaying, etc. 

It is normal for Men to customize their women after receiving Ownership. Hair color, enhanced tits and ass, tattoos, branding, makeup and clothing, etc. 

Women are not allowed to vote. 

Women are not allowed to be paid more than the Man with the lowest income in their workplace. 

Men can choose to have Their women‚Äôs paychecks sent to Their bank accounts. 

Women are not allowed to hold positions other than ones of service. This can include positions like teaching (but NEVER to Men), waitressing, stripping, secretary, janitor work, etc). 

Owned women cannot be abused without their Owners consent, but it is expected that they obey Men to the best of their limited ability otherwise. 

This was all I could think of off the top of my head. Any suggestions are welcome! As well as corrections, I know that although Men and I might have similar agendas, we don‚Äôt have similar brains and so I know to accept Male criticism over any opinions I hold (or once held hehe).",Ideal Patriarchy,2.0,2.0

But for now, I'm looking at a small vintage or modern villa home somewhere outside Cairo, preferably Hurghada, Alex, Sharm, Port Said, or by the coastal lines of the Red Sea. But where do I start?

***What's This Post All About?***

The first thing you'll notice is a stickied comment right at the top. We call this the ""Front Desk"". Every day a moderator will create a new sticky comment that includes links to community announcements, fantastic posts that deserve more attention, and generally the simplest and easiest way to interact with the moderators of this community. The rest of the post is designed for general discussion and content/questions that might not need their own post.

If you are new please mention that when you comment. There are no stupid questions but ""shills"" (paid accounts with the intent to disrupt the sub) are real. This community sees a lot of trolls. If you do not distinguish yourself as someone with genuine questions it is likely that members of our community will assume you are just spreading ""FUD"" (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt). I hate that I have to give you this warning but it is just the nature of the beast at this point.

Physical attraction is subjective so I won‚Äôt go into too much detail, but historically I mostly am into white dudes with pretty dicks who have some muscle/tone to them. BUT you don‚Äôt have to be a bodybuilder and that isn‚Äôt a dealbreaker. 

Personality wise, please don‚Äôt be an entitled, mean asshole. I value kindness, respect, communication and trust over everything. If I feel you‚Äôre not being respectful towards me I will cut you off. You must also understand what SSC sex is. Please be in central London and able to host, although I won‚Äôt ever be able to stay nights because I am from a conservative family who would not be happy about this (oops!).

s4shcm,"If I see you in my store without a mask, I'm going to fuck with you. I strategically block aisles with carts, totes and explicitly give customers the wrong directions to their favorite out-of-stock product. You need to give us space while we try to do our jobs.

In contrast, if an elderly person wearing a mask comes and ask me to help them with something, I will drop what I'm doing and help them find it, as I walk through the horde of mouthbreathers... leaving a rancid trail of farts in my wake.

Who else fucks with maskless customers at a grocery store?

Edit: I am a lowly Kroger Associate with Covid scheduled to work on Monday. Customers should not be allowed to come within one meter of an employee and breathe in their faces. Be sensible, make people stand 6 feet apart, and wear a mask. I am being asked to work one day shy of the CDC isolation guidelines by an incompetent cult of middle management. 

Edit 2: Stop politicizing science, give us hazard pay, and sanitize the fucking stores. I am not a fucking liberal because I don't want to catch or transmit a communicable disease from or to another human being. I am tired of seeing you wingnuts, Karens, and bootlickers dragging your children around a septic tank. No wonder we can't keep our schools open.

Edit 3: Imagine how long it takes an understaffed store to break down the equipment and sanitize our workstations by the end of our shifts. Managers call in workers from other stores and clean up before corporate shows up for an inspection. Trust me, you don't want to eat anything from the meat department. Have you ever read The Jungle? I've found curdled milk in dairy. New hires take up to 4 hours to work dairy carts or just leave them in an aisle if they get pinged to work in another department. That is two hours outside of the basic food safety zone. I am surprised that there has not been a salmonella outbreak in the produce department. Did I mention that almost nobody is trained to do work in another department and we're shuffled around the store when another employee calls in sick? We do not know what we're doing. It is reckless to keep these stores running at this point. Employees should NOT be working some of these jobs by themselves.

Edit 4: Good luck finding groceries next week guys. I am tired of people giving me shit because there isn't a product on the shelf. Order your fucking groceries online.

Edit 5: My rant hit the front page. I'll post a TikTok video of this foul shitshow of a store on Monday.

Edit 6: Boycott Kroger. Fuck scabs, shills, and your corporate social media accounts. Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, you're cool, peace y'all, I'm out.

Edit 7: Have you ever worked in constuction or a related field that requires wearing a respirator? If you answered yes, did the NIOSH approved face mask stop the silica from scarring your lungs? Do you or a loved one have meso-theoia-fucking-oma? If you answered no... you are admitting that a well-fitting N95 mask stops 95% of particles in the air from going inside of your lungs. Face masks ""work."" When somebody brings up this fact, they often say that they only work if ""they're used correctly."" Well, can you drop the whataboutism and read the instructions? It takes 30 seconds.What is your major malfunction Private Pyle?

Edit 8: People fucking died a horrible death over a century ago in the trenches of WWI for your fucking freedom. My great grandfather was mustard gassed by the Germans. My greatmother lived through the Great Depression and would slap the fuck out of you. Have you ever seen a book of ration stamps from WWII? Have you ever heard somebody say ""Duck and Cover?""

s5ah2i,"This subreddit is the most bitter, miserable and humourless place on the internet. You guys fucking SUCK. You are singlehandedly responsible for ruining H3 for the rest of us. Any time Ethan so happens to make a joke about ANYTHING there's major backlash on here and he has to conform to your stupid, overly sensitive standards. You are ANTI-humour on a subreddit about a COMEDY SHOW.

We all know where it went wrong.. Trisha was introduced, brough in a new wave of fans, humiliated herself thoroughly and now we have a residue of incel single cat mothers as fans (that's you, you're the incel single cat moms who hate jokes).

And now Ethan has to cater to YOU because he knows you make up the majority of his audience, you drama obsessed morons dictate how the show is run and that's why all we have now is constant petty drama no sane human being is entertained by. You are so miserable in life that you feast on the misery you cause of internet personalities you don't even know. Is that not sad? Are you self aware in the slightest? How do you not hate yourself for being so all-consumed by the misery you cause of people who have no idea you exist?

But what happened to the fans who were here before Trisha? Where are all the people who liked H3 for the light-hearted goofs and gaffs? They fucking left. You know why? Because Ethan changed for the worst. We don't like seeing him make people miserable, we don't like him turning on ""friends of the show"". And even those of us who stayed are being pushed away because we point out how Ethan is doing AWFUL things. This subreddit doesn't allow even the most benign constructive criticism, pointing out these things is met with ""YOU'RE A FAKE FAN"", motherfucker I've been here since 2015 and you wanna call me a fake fan because I don't support Ethan stabbing people in the back?

And while I'm at it I'm gonna point out something so fucking annoying about you morons; any time there is valid criticism and you can't deny the truth you pull the ""JuSt ChEcKeD pOsT HiStOrY, OP IS AN INCEL!!! LOOK RIGHT HERE, HE COMMENTED ON r/Cringetopia!!!"" Shut the fuck up omfg, if you disagree I'd assume you'd at least be able to explain why, but you can't so you go looking through their posts for dirt. This is the most pathetic act a redditor can make and it happens every single time someone on this sub has constructive criticism.

&#x200B;

Joe Rogan fucking humiliated Ethan by not even acknowledging his existence so he moved right on to Jordan Peterson. Jordan Peterson makes Ethan's intellect look that that of a caveman's. Steven crowder would've made Ethan look like a cretin if Ethan had the balls to actually debate him, it was miserable and cowardly for Ethan to reach out to Crowder for a debate just to pull that dumb shit and waste everyone's time.

Ethan is desperate for drama because he knows its the only thing that will satisfy you depressed, lonely, petty (and no doubt obese) imbeciles.

sbms8q,,Talk in the comments like this is all a big reality show. Or something idk,,
s9yg2u,,"I'm not the most Dom looking but I'll leave you gapping, filled and wishing for more",,
s8u2yc,"Before I say what I'm going to say, I want everyone to know that I am in no way excusing what Chuck did to Jenny in the first episode. Also be prepared, this'll go on a while.

In Season 3 of Gossip Girl, the climax of the entire arc is Jenny and Chuck sleeping together as they are both in deep states of hurt and remorse. The scene is depicted in rather disturbing light (literally, the lighting in that scene is ominous) and the music betrays thoughts of shame from both of them. To an outside view, their relationship is a very dangerous and unhealthy one. Chuck tried to rape her when she was 14, he's called her a slut to her brother's face, they've since then technically become siblings, and she is underage by the time they have sex. While I think the writers were very guilty of slut-shaming the female characters and misunderstanding how to writer sexuality from the point of view of a woman, I still think this scene alone between them has some real weight to it, and it has lingered with me for a long time because the image with the music, and the acting was clearly thought out. Afterwards, of course, when it comes out what's happened, all of the other characters totally freak out and act in ways that are beyond helpful to either people or to themselves.

I often give the writers and characters too much credit, so if it bothers you to see them fleshed out beyond what was really given in the series, well...be warned I guess because this is just one of my ...I suppose, guilty pleasures. Anyway, I'll continue.

Their relationship left a lasting impression on me, and always seemed like there was meant to be more to it but was cut short because of Taylor Momsen's leaving the show. In the 3rd Season, Jenny's character builds up to becoming the main villain, the final boss if you will. Her actions and words are cold, cruel, and polarizing until she has no one left but Chuck. The part I think is interesting is the original deceit towards the viewers. We continue to see her unique friendship with Nate manifest as him being her ""hero"" as he comes to her aid multiple times, some times for social climbing, others to save her from sexual assault. I'm personally a Jenny sympathizer as I can actually really understand how she could fall for someone like him when it seems like no one around listens to her (especially her father who knowingly allows her to attend a school that is kind of the root of a lot of her demons). Another reason I think she is so honed in on Nate, though is that she is always mimicking the life of Blair Waldorf. If she got with Nate, she would have truly succeeded at phase one in the life of becoming Queen B, someone she consistently is obsessed with. Nate continues his heroics, and is pretty admirable in his attempts to be a good friend and hero to her.

But, in episodes that do note feature these moments between them, Chuck is her other guy. She and him actually have an unspoken understanding in Season 3 to have each other's backs. In episode 4 of Season 3, they work together to get Blair to back off of Constance and refocus her energies on NYU. During this, when Jenny dresses up for Olivia's movie premier, Chuck pours over her with praise for her physical appearance and I hate to say it because of how creepy their original relationship is, but I honestly believe there is some kind of weird chemistry between the two actors, thus between the characters like they really know each other in a way I don't think any of the characters were aware of by that point. So then later in episode 10, when Damien comes into the picture, we first see Chuck enter Lily's penthouse where she, Rufus, and Jenny are casually hanging out. One of the weird things I noticed in this scene is that it opens up with Jenny wanting to ""broaden her horizons"" with guys, setting the stage for an existing desire to get with someone from pool of elite guys. In this scene, I was surprised to see how Chuck is smiling at her while she's laying on the couch. I'm not even saying in a creepy way, rather his general happiness to see her. And his eyes follow her the entire scene as she volunteers to entertain Damien. When she tells him ""you owe me"" he returns this statement by saying, ""with pleasure.""

This is a moment that shows once again that these two have formed some kind of friendship, be it siblingish, friendly, or even flirty. And in the end, he ""rescues her"" from big-bad-Damien's evil clutches when they're experimenting with drug dealing. Their storyline in this episode ends with Chuck taking her home, warning her off of those kinds of guys, and her saying that for the first time in a long time she had actual fun and that she's so bored and lonely being queen. Chuck acknowledges in this scene that he's understood her ever since he met her, and he even said this in the earlier episode (3x04). This is when I see the beginning of what is the build-up to them sleeping together in the last episode of season 3, believe it or not. As the Season progresses, she goes through her relationship with Damien, and then latches onto Nate. 

While the other characters are fooled into believing Jenny has an inappropriate attachment to Nate, given that he was taken at the time, underneath the surface the person she is actually bonding with is Chuck. When she starts hanging out with Nate near the end of the series, while his relationship is on the rocks with Serena, she continues to confide in Chuck for ""good"" advice on how to get closer to the object of her desires. During these moments, Chuck flirts with her but gives her what advice he can (not helpful advice in the end, might I add lmao). I remember in the episode when Chuck, Nate, and Jenny go to that art show together. At one point, Dan, a concerned and protective older brother, asks why she's hanging out with those two and she says ""well Chuck's harmless so long as this place doesn't run out of ice."" At one point, Chuck tries to convince Nate that Jenny no longer looks like a child.

Ok, I've really rambled so let me really get to the point. In the end, Chuck and Jenny sleep together, blah blah blah. Before they do, though, they had that heart to heart about being miserable, something I believe they've had in common since the beginning of the show. 

This is where I get to the point. I am by no means a Chuck and Jenny shipper given...well, how could someone date someone who tried to rape them, who is technically their step brother, and is clearly head over heals for another person? Like, all of that to me is kind of an understatement. But, what bothers me is how their relationship blows up. Now, unlike some people, I completely understand why Dan flipped his shit when he found out what happened, that they slept together. He literally saw Chuck trying to force himself on Jenny years ago, and now Jenny is crying in the chapel of the hospital after the fact. Jenny was very important to Dan and he felt it was his job to protect her. I get every ounce of satisfaction seeing him punch Chuck, because how in the world was he supposed to understand the complicated nuances between Jenny and Chuck while seeing red? Chuck is then painted as this horrible monster, yet Jenny is run out of town.

Now on the one hand, I think Chuck should've known better altogether than to take the risk of entangling with Jenny. But, I don't blame him for her actions, as I've seen a lot of other people also have conceded on here. I think what is really sad in the end, is that it seemed like Chuck was the only person that truly listened to her. That's what bothers me so much about their relationship. In season 2, when she confronted him about how she would never live in the same space as him, and overall confronted him about what he did to her in the first episode at the Kiss on the Lips party, eventually he apologizes and tells her he'll move out if their families join together. This really is one of the only times a guy listens to what she says and follows up on it without controlling her, getting upset her, or shaming her. Their friendship was rooted in something really messed up, and that was that she knew well and good how bad of a person he could be, but in the end he was one of the only people who treated her like an adult. Even in the last scene of Season 3, he attempts to stand up for her to Blair about how she ""needed someone to be there for her.""

I always feel sad for Jenny because her needs are always passed over, and she gets slut-shamed all of the darn time. Her own father barely blinked about her being bullied in high school. So the fact that the only person who really heard her out was the guy that tried to rape her really seems sucky to me.

Whew, I feel kind of crazy for going on this rant. I will wrap up this by just making these points:

\-Jenny and Chuck's relationship reminded me of season 1 Blair in Chuck from the first 1-5 episodes, when they are just friends and Blair's dating Nate, and Chuck gives her advice on how to sleep with him. They scheme together, and he encourages her to give into her true desires.

\-I sometimes think about the scene of her crying after they slept together. I've seen some people suggesting that she was being childish, but honestly I think she was just breaking down by that point. Her father and some of her friends (Nate, weirdly enough) really hammered into her head that her virginity was something THEY could control, that she should NEVER throw it away. So, I don't think it's very surprising that she would feel pretty ashamed afterwards. I think if they had, I don't know, treated her like a human being with rights to her own body, she would've had a much easier time coming to terms with what happened. I also think at that time, sleeping with Chuck was just the cherry on top of her disaster sundae, where she already knew her father no longer wanted her there, and all the people she isolated herself from were going to hate her even worse after what transpired. 

\-I genuinely think the writers had some kind of creepy, sexist view about women and their sexuality. The guys got away with being really promiscuous, but the girl sleeps with one dude and she is automatically a slut. It's pretty creepy. Am I the only one who thinks this?

My brother has always been my best friend because if my mum or my dad did something stupid or mean we would always agree that it was wrong and talk about how we didnt wanna do that when we were older. Recently my mum bought another house to move away from my dad because she ‚Äúcant stand his abusive behaviour‚Äù (not physical just verbal, but really in my eyes my dad is just teasing and my mum takes jokes too seriously which gets out of hand) my brother stayed living w me and my dad for a while but then moved in with my mum because he said he couldn‚Äôt stand our dad either. My mum and brother now live really far away (atleast a 3 hr drive and in a different zone so when covid lockdowns happen we cant travel to see them) at first i was really torn between my mum and brother and my dad and didnt know who i was on the side of, (i wasnt going to move down there with them because i have a job where i live w my dad and a bf and friends which i dont want to leave) eventually my bf helped me figure out that i didnt need to pick a side and it was better to not get involved. So i ended up just missing my mum and brother a lot and wanting them to move back up, forgetting the real reason why she moved away (cuz her and my dad dont get along). 

This is the problem: My mum and brother came back up for Christmas and New Years and since they came back up it has been chaos. My mum favourites my brother so much and my brother doesnt like me much anymore, he gets really angry really quickly like a switch and he is scary and intimidating (hes two years older than me btw) he gangs ip on me with my mum over small things, ive always had fights with my mum over little things and my brother either took my side or stayed out of it. Now he gets involved everytime i fight with her and always takes her side even if he doesnt care or agree. My bf told me to just walk away when the argument becomes a ganging up on me kinda thing, so ive been doing that and now im getting called a coward for ‚Äúwalking away from my responsibilities‚Äù whatever that means? I am 18 and probably in my prime for having a bit of an attitude so sometimes i start arguments over stupid things, when this happens with my dad however he deals with it well and doesnt yell at me, he understands that i sometimes get upset over trivial things. He realises if he stays calm then ill stay calm. My mum doesnt and neither does my brother, my mum also has some brain damage i think, a psychiatrist told her she did one day, and she was in a bad car accident as a baby which required surgery and all that jazz. So i think my mum is bad at socialising and bad at understanding people and things happening around her, however this doesnt excuse the fact that she is so unwilling to change herself or work to be different, she never admits to being wrong and is quite entitled. My brother also has no respect for me or anyone. He orders my mum to do things for him, and ‚Äújokes‚Äù about my boyfriend being crazy or a weirdo or other mean things. I cant stand it when he insults my boyfriend because there has been this big shenanigans about how ‚Äúmy boyfriend doesnt try hard enough to be friends with my brother and he is BANNED from our house..‚Äù thats what my mum said btw. She attacked me out of nowhere with that one. 

Anyway i just need some help understanding this situation. I always feel like im in the wrong and i always end up feeling guilty after every single argument, i dont know when im right and when im wrong. I am pretty sure my family is manipulating me into feeling this way, idk how theyre doing it, but i think the environment is extremely toxic. I have talked to depression hotline councillors about my situation and they have said it sounds very toxic and like i need to get away or get some help. Im currently not earning enough to move out and i like my dad and would like to be supported by my family for as long as possible, so that isnt really an option. Im not really looking for solutions because i understand its not an easy fix. I just kind of needed to get this out somewhere because i dont really have any friends that i can trust at the moment and have had very bad luck with friends in the past two years with all of them turning on me and stuff so i only really have my bf to talk to and he must get sick of it sometimes and i feel bad for putting it all on him. I just need to kind of hear what other people think so i can be a bit more at ease. Also i understand that my story is kind of missing heaps of stuff but this is the best i could do without writing out my whole life story.

We have a part time nanny to fill in a couple days for 4-10 hours on those 2 days.

I wasn't aware of what she was making so I asked my wife.
$65 A DAY regardless of hours worked.
This isn't through some agency, this is a friend of hers.
I told her that was completely unacceptable and we should be paying her hourly and at least 50% more than what a long day equalled out to. ($7.20)
She even has to drive like 30+ miles to get to our house.

My wife completely disagrees and is mad that I want to pay her more.

She should get paid at least one travel time and at the very minimum 10 an hour which is still garbage pay.

I just can't believe how adamant my wife is about paying her such a shitty wage.

""She doesn't even have a car payment!""
""She has another family she nannies for!""
""She lives with family and doesn't pay rent!""
And so on and so on.

IDGAF about these things. She deserves more. She does cleaning around the house like dishes and laundry and does an excellent job with the kid and the kid loves her.

s87efz,"A few minutes ago I saw a meme that was comparing Sylphie, Eris, Gislaine, Roxy and the Greyrat (anime only) family, that had:

Eris as pure but a bit horny;

Gislaine as horny but a bit innocent;

Roxy as the balance;

Sylphie as pure 

And the Greyrats as total perverts.

Immediately after I saw this, I disagreed with Sylphie's, Eris and Gislaine's placement due to Eris being too horny(the OP was a web novel reader so he should know this), Gislaine being described by I think Elianise as kind of na√Øve in her matting session and just generally not appearing too horny, and Sylphie because the way she has so many wet dreams about Rudy even after years she last saw him(LN 9)(and don't forget he was seven at the time) and how open she is to doing a lot of lewd stuff(things even Rudy is hesitant about) for Rudeus, always felt kind of pervert to me.

After I wrote a bit about that, I thought of suggesting some other woman of the series to be put in Sylphie's place, but I genuinely couldn't think of any kind of important anime only woman character that is ""pure"" and, even with WN spoilers, the only one I would even consider to give that tittle would be Norm, who is also married to a 500 year old dude, so I don't know if that would be even considered being pure but whatever. 

So, does anyone remember of any genuinely pure, kind of important woman character in Mushoku Tensei?

rwfokg,"I'm an INFP female. My INTJ male partner sent me an email saying he was ending our relationship and blocking me on all platforms (including email and phone). He was borrowing my car and returned it before sending me the email. He left the key in my building courtyard and we did not see each other.

Our 2 year dating anniversary is tomorrow. Before this happened, I lost my temper on the phone because he said he'd be over Sunday morning. I waited for him to contact me and he did not. I called him at 1pm and asked if anything was wrong, if everything was okay. He cheerfully said he was about to text me and lost track of time. I told him I worried when I didn't know what was going on and asked for an apology. He became defensive and the situation escalated. 

We were both feeling a lot of pressure from the holidays (which actually went quite well with our families), Omichron canceling activities we were looking forward to, and the previous day, he was pushing a conversation to discuss our long term future and our plan to make it successful. I confessed to him that I was anxious because two months prior he lied to me and cheated on me and has not talked to his therapist about the incident yet. I have talked to mine. We discussed holding off on big decisions until after he talked to his therapist. I was worried about planning for a long term future without fixing our present problems. 

I believe he reacted from a place of trauma when he made his decision to break up over email. After 2 years together, if we are to break up, I want the respect of a face to face. I'm at a loss. We love each other deeply, but the relationship has been tremendously difficult, and in his view, beyond repair. I disagree and understand there is a lot of work to do, and I am trying to decide if I am willing to do it after all that has occurred.

""**A 16-year-old boy who plunged a knife into a woman‚Äôs chest in a homophobic attack has been put behind bars**.

Jack Green‚Äôs victim bared her permanent scar in court and described how the unprovoked assault in Canterbury city centre destroyed her life.

**The teenage thug, who can now be named for the first time after reporting restrictions were overturned by KentOnline, was yesterday handed 54 months inside a Young Offenders‚Äô Institute**.

Canterbury Crown Court was told how Megan Murphy and three friends ran into Green and four others in Direct Pizza in Northgate in the early hours of October.

**Initially conversations remained friendly, however, Green took issue when Miss Murphy‚Äôs friend, Lewis Eaves, said he was bisexual**.

**Shortly after, Miss Murphy‚Äôs group left towards Victoria Row when they noticed Green and four others behind them**.

**The group following smashed up a nearby telephone box and armed themselves with makeshift weapons, then bombarded Miss Murphy and her friends with bottles and bricks**.

**Green also continued to shout homopobhic language towards Mr Eaves**.

‚ÄúThe defendant‚Äôs group appeared behind them after looping around a side street, and having appeared for a second time, they began to throw glass bottles and bricks at the group,‚Äù prosecutor James Benson said.

‚ÄúNo one was injured at that stage.‚Äù

CCTV played in court showed the groups stood face to face for about two minutes, with Green‚Äôs group shouting abuse including ‚Äúshe‚Äôs feisty‚Äù and ‚Äúshe‚Äôs dead‚Äù.

When the altercation moved off screen, Miss Murphy could be heard screaming in shock, before Green‚Äôs group were seen fleeing.

**Prosecutor James Benson described how Green drew a curved blade from his right pocket and moved towards Miss Murphy in Victoria Row**.

‚Äú**He raised the knife over his head, Megan Murphy raised her hands to protect herself, she stepped backwards, and the defendant plunged the knife into her upper right chest,"" he said**.

**The blade pierced two inches under her skin, missing vital organs and soft tissue, allowing Miss Murphy to make a full physical recovery**.

But she is still left with the mental trauma.

Her scar visible in court, Miss Murphy said she was forced to place her studies on hold while processing her ordeal.

‚ÄúRegularly I wake up in the middle of the night replaying the attack,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúIt has absolutely scarred me for life - I am a shadow of my former self.‚Äù

Mr Benson asked Miss Murphy to turn to the judge.

‚ÄúIs that the scar on your chest?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù she replied.

‚ÄúHow long is that expected to last?"" Mr Benson continued.

‚ÄúFor the rest of my life,‚Äù Miss Murphy responded.

Green, supported by family in court, appeared visibly distressed as Miss Murphy told of her battle with post-traumatic stress disorder.

Mr Eaves described the attack as ‚Äúanimalistic rage‚Äù, adding he was ‚Äúappalled by the biphobic attitude,‚Äù in a statement read in court.

Green pleaded guilty to wounding with intent and using threatening words and behaviour at a previous hearing.

**He has one previous conviction, for affray, after chasing two women and vandalising their car**.

The judge, Recorder Matthew McDonagh, ruled Mr Eaves disclosing his sexual orientation ‚Äúculminated in the attack.‚Äù

Telling Green he played a leading role, the judge added: ‚ÄúLewis Eaves was physically targeted and called a derogatory word by you.

‚ÄúYou lunged at Miss Murphy and she raised her arms to protect herself. You plunged that knife from an overhead position into the right chest of Miss Murphy.

‚ÄúYou shouted homophobic abuse, you had a knife, and you used it.‚Äù

Green, of Pye Alley Lane, Whitstable, will have time spent on remand deducted from his overall sentence.

His lawyer, Paul Jackson, said Green was ‚Äúdeeply ashamed, remorseful‚Äù and ‚Äúdeeply upset as to the pain he had caused‚Äù.

He added Green wished to hand his victim a letter apologising for his actions, and claimed the attack would not have happened had he not drunk cider and wine.

Green hopes to work in construction and distance himself from negative influences in his life, Mr Jackson added"".

rguxk1,"A little bit of backstory: i've always been into mythology, but i was indoctrinated with the ""Islam is the only true religion"" pill as a kid. So i never really looked into islam as i already thought it's true, i was curious about other religions &amp; mythologies though. Always wondered why did these people believe in what they did. As i was learning those other faiths and mythologies with the pre-assumption that they were all false, i always looked at them from the eye of a skeptic. Also i've been a non-religious muslim for like most of my life, never really cared about Islam i still had belief in Allah (god) just not the religious. So recently like 5 months ago i thought why not study my own religion, got the quran started reading it. Me reading the quran i smelled the same bullshit i found on the other mythologies and religions, so i had tons of questions right off the bat. Asked my mom &amp; my local imam (priest), they have the same replies, you know:

""Your head is getting clouded by the devil""

""Don't ask too many questions""

""Get these thoughts out or you'll end up in hell""

Started looking on the internet, stumbled upon the criticism of islam, realized i wasn't the only one with these questions and doubts. The answers weren't just insufficient to me but to these guys as well.
After then i completely left Islam upon realizing ""holy shit it's filled with bullshit"". I still had belief in God tho

Later i got into philosophy (phil of religion TBP), through watching debates between theists &amp; atheists to understand the technical terms of that branch of philosophy. After learning a bit more i completely lost faith in God. **But the regret part comes in when i realize** that i can't rely on the beautiful delusions anymore, when i realize this life might be the only i get and i'm slowly moving towards a death with no do-overs, it becomes scary. When i have to go through tough times &amp; face tough questions i can't rely on God no more. Honestly sometimes i wish i could delete all these memories and go back to being delusional person i was. Ignorance is truly bliss  as they say. Anyways thanks for reading through this long badly written paragraph.",I'm honestly regretting learning the bad side of Islam & leaving.,2.0,2.0

s66mkj,"TL;DR: a junkie was on my train very high on some serious shit and was providing some quality entertainment for me and group of strangers while the train was stationed due to an incident 

Edit: this post is not meant insensitively, having grown up in areas where drug problems are a very common thing, I know it is a terrible disease and that the people who end up like this don‚Äôt end up here by choice. I‚Äôm merely sharing my experience as a female travelling alone at night and how this could have turned out to be a scary experience but was made pretty lighthearted by some kind strangers. And also typical Hurstbridge line shenanigans.

Was catching the Hurstbridge line home alone towards Eltham tonight after dinner with friends in the city. Got on at Flinders at 8.19 (17/01/21). A few dodgy looking blokes jumped on my carriage so I moved to the next one just to avoid any possible conversation (seemed harmless but I just didn‚Äôt wanna deal). Next thing I know they‚Äôre smoking in the carriage divider, I figure weed/darts, whatever. 

One of them then stumbles into my carriage, no biggie there‚Äôs lot of people on the train anyway, I just avoid eye contact and hope he keeps walking. He loiters and takes a seat next to a teenage girl sitting by herself, just in front to the right of me. Here we go. He starts asking her question that I can‚Äôt hear/understand because he‚Äôs slurring a lot and mumbling. She awkwardly tries to divert conversation in hopes of him leaving her alone but he remains, so I get up and ask if she‚Äôd like to sit with me and she replies yes and joins me where I‚Äôm sitting. We chatted a bit and she was really thankful for me saving her, and by this point old mate was passed out in his seat anyway. Turns out it was her first time getting the train alone poor thing. 

She gets off a few stops before mine (was getting picked up by her parents so she was getting home safe) and as she does there‚Äôs an announcement saying the train would be stationed for a while as there was an incident a couple stops away that police had requested the trains be halted. Ended up being stopped for around 20 mins and in that time old mate is nearly falling out of his seat, smacked out of his mind, head falling one way, then the other. This group of guys seated just behind me starts laughing their heads off watching the guy‚Äôs head wobbles, and they took a picture of him with his poor neck bent backwards (I‚Äôm talking like birds eye view angle) and I couldn‚Äôt help but giggle. I made eye contact with one of them and he flashed me the picture and I started to laugh so hard, he really did look ridiculous. The guys proceeded to try and wake the guy up and see if he was alright and he eventually stirred and was chatting to them, again hard to understand but then he begins dancing and rapping and just doing I don‚Äôt even know what. At one point I thought he was going to fall into my lap or spill his iced coffee all over me, as it was already spilt all over the floor. 

I couldn‚Äôt stop laughing the whole time along with those guys, it honestly just made my night. They worked out he‚Äôd been smoking what they could only determine to be meth in the carriage divider. Figures.

Idk if by any chance any of them are reading this I wanted to say what the fuck was that and also thanks for the laugh and the pics and videos you air dropped to me, and for checking that I was right to get home after they were getting off at the stop before mine. I‚Äôll definitely never forget this train trip.",Cant stop thinking about my train trip home tonight,2.0,2.0

I could feel that they were going to ask me to look after some of their stuff. I didn‚Äôt want to bring up the issue in case it caused an argument being that they were so blatantly ignorant. But since I was rightfully annoyed, this was the exchange:

sg9xvf,"Before I go on, for the best part I love the comic community and have been an active part of it for 30 years now. So just to be clear this doesn't reflect my view on everybody.

Anyway... Please do not go into actual comic book shops, whip out your phone and give staff grief over the price of an item JUST BECAUSE you saw one cheaper on Ebay.

I work in a comic shop. Our prices are arguably absurdly cheap, yet I still, especially in recent years, have some of the meanest and most pedantic people arguing with me just because I won't match a price they have seen somewhere online.

My absolute pet hate is the growing amount of people coming in asking me what I have that is a safe bet for slab and profit. Its disgusting that you ask that. I don't agree with grading most of the time anyway, but to be enough of stingy cunt that you don't even want to do the research yourself, and simply want to turn a quick profit with my assistance, is just gross. I love talking comics in the shop, and I'll help anybody in any way I can, but not if you expect me to be your profit bitch! 

I've had people straight up offer me deals to supply their ebay channels! Usually guys in their late 20s and 30s, but it's unbelievable that this is becoming even more of a common occurrence, and each person who has asked me  I have politely dismissed through gritted teeth.

I'd rather allow one of the younger kids to pay me a few quid a week so that eventually they can get their hands on the rarer items they are normally priced out of, than sell to these ignorant, rude and quite frankly distopian ebay hounders. The kids are actually, despite their own limited knowledge of comics sometimes, by far the coolest by way of the fact that they are far more invested in actually reading!!!

This rant has been brought on by a bloke who came in the shop today, asked to see the inside of a rare comic. This was after he had spent a good 15 mins comparing prices on ebay throughout the shop on his phone. 

Anyway... I said he could look but I would have to hold it for him while he looked. I do this with most comics over a certain price, especially while we still have the social distancing rules over the past couple of years. He wasn't happy about this, and proceeded to turn the pages himself despite me asking him not to. I was polite and tried not to make a big deal about it.

When I'd shown him through he kept shaking his head. I asked him what was wrong and he laughed, pushed the comic towards me without care for it whatsoever and stormed out of the shop without a word. He then proceeded to stand by the window and shake his head at me in disapproval, the weirdo just wanted to make me feel bad for some reason. Yeah lovely way to treat somebody who is having to work and is just trying to serve you.

I looked the comic up afterwards to double check. Our price of ¬£250 was spot on, with some copies going up to ¬£400. Looking further into it I saw that one ended at auction the other day for just under ¬£200. Maybe that was it?! Either way...

... PLEASE be nice to staff in comic stores regarding issues like this. Its a far more time consuming and stressful job than many people realise, especially over the last couple of years. Giving LCBS shade just because they won't help you beat an ebay price is a low blow.

On top of that, I learned about and just started listening to the Talking Sopranos podcast, and now I'm on this sub yapping more than six barbers. But here's the thing that made me stop and say ""Madonn!"":

Lately, Sopranos characters have been turning up in my dreams. The first dream, it was Chrissy. I didn't talk to him or anything, but he was there. The second dream was Uncle Junior. In this dream, he walked in the room and I said, ""Uncle Jun', what are you doing here?"" I actually said it out loud in my sleep and woke my wife up. The last dream was Carmela, Meadow, and Tony. In the dream I was at my ex in-laws' house talking with my ex MIL. Somehow she morphed into Carmela, then I was with my daughter and the two of us were outside talking to Meadow. Carmela called me back into the house because Tony was on the phone and wanted to talk to me. He chewed me out (apparently I had been flirting with the neighbor's wife, who were connected people or something) and told me I had to go and make things right. The dream went on for a bit longer, but this is all I can really remember clearly.

s9sxwa,"Hello Fellow Apes- This is how I  invested $126,000 In Gamestop $GME  Around August 5th 2020 for around  $4.50 because of the most simple DD but failed to trust my gut, a really  interesting story.

Note: I sold  very early because melvin Capital also shorted a few of my other stocks  CD Projekt and I felt i need to move on because It at one time was a  rigged game, my biggest financial mistake of all time.

In  late Summer of 2020 during the chaos, I decided to get back into gaming  on PC as I was at my desk at home for 18 hrs a day trading the market,  Researching etc.

I wanted to get some items for this, stream deck, some games etc.

See captions below for the rest of my story.

[The day I realized Gamestop was Epic. ](https://preview.redd.it/0ckc7xqjr5d81.jpg?width=1197&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2e8685f7ad05275cf247ca19d6b1d6d9975334f9)

[Before I even looked at the short &#37; I was long. ](https://preview.redd.it/3ktlxc4ir5d81.jpg?width=1048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6d0f98a02c6d4c6e9ca53eaf425792f93057fa08)

[ Basic technicals & I noticed that 96&#37; of the float was short.  ](https://preview.redd.it/e6s0woppr5d81.jpg?width=1050&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e842be73fa62e08b03ec059ae299f0d0f706a199)

[ After a few weeks I knew this was going to be massive and I had 28,000 shares under 5 dollar average. ](https://preview.redd.it/464z8fnvr5d81.jpg?width=667&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=72b1cf5ad8576b7eebb259239ff5800b58dcbe76)

I was long $GME and waiting for the  ""massive squeeze"", I had done well swinging other things particularly  $MRCB that I almost wrecked myself because of its short squeeze  ironically.

I shorted $MCRB a week  later in august at 4 dollars on a FDA approval gone wrong and in less  than a few minutes it ran to $20+ at one point almost 700% that day. I  covered fast trying to make up my loss going long, It worked out but  could have cost me 7+ figures if it didn't.

I rarely short and this was my first lesson to hang up my short shorts for good.

I  started focusing my attention back to Gamestop $GME because I believed  this squeeze could be even bigger than $MCRB 700%+ run in a day.

I  continued to hold and was bullish, I did add more shares to swing trade  trying to feel how the stock traded but I started to doubt myself.

I  listened to the market and started to sell as Melvin capital started  shorting another one of my positions CD Projekts -Witcher / Cyberpunk  2077.

I really wish I had stuck  with my plan and held into the mother of all squeezes with those 4  dollar shares.  I don't know if I would have held past $300, looking  back I really wonder if it had not been for me also investing in CD  projekts if I would have held. Dang cyberpunk 2077, they should have  just made a Witcher 4.....

Ironically I think I could somehow blame cyberpunk 2077 for me investing in gamestop and also the same reason I sold it.

I am thankful it was a lesson learned.

PCR testing is becoming increasingly harder to get and they aren‚Äôt for any/everybody anymore, the virus is spreading out of control in the two largest states in the country.

Currently, if you have symptoms, it‚Äôs line up for a whole day in a queue for PCR test then wait for a godforsaken number of days for the result (something that induces a lot of anxiety). 

Or, go for the other test, the RAT, and well, you join the rat race to try and find one. Cuz they are bloody sold out *everywhere* - finding one, you have to be in the right place at the right time, need a lot of luck - and then you have to pay for the bloody privilege, $30 a box of two, $70 for a box of five were the most recent prices I saw. And then your result won‚Äôt be as accurate as the PCR. 

RATs are actually pretty expensive - and I can highly imagine that there will be some people, I‚Äôm thinking those on the poverty line and lower income workers who won‚Äôt want to keep buying them perpetually, because assuming you do a test for every single time you have symptoms, these out of pocket costs are gunna add up pretty big. That just means more cases will go undetected. 

Is this how we‚Äôre supposed to live for the time to come? Because that‚Äôs no way to live in my opinion. Living with Covid should mean RATs are free, as they are in the UK and USA.  Should be subsidised by Medicare. We don‚Äôt pay for sexual health tests. We didn‚Äôt pay for Covid tests before RATs were introduced and we shouldn‚Äôt be starting now. What we are currently doing isn‚Äôt working


TL;DR  - it‚Äôs currently too difficult (and costly) to get tested. Not sustainable to just leave as, RATs should be free and PCR testing sites that were closed should be reopened",The Federal Government is making a HUGE mistake by not subsidising / making RAT‚Äôs free,2.0,2.0

sauxxg,"Have been living in CPH for over 5 years now and keep wondering how food delivery companies get away with generally high delivery prices. For instance, last year Wolt changed their price model so that delivery price goes from 19 DKK for under 500m and then increases by 10 every 500m. This means that delivery from a place that is between 2.5 and 3 km away is DKK 69 or around 9.3 EUR which is rather pricey. 

Of course, the salaries here are quite high, so people tend to be able to afford this. However, it does seem to be on the higher end compared to other European capitals, even expensive ones, like London (2.5-3 km distance delivery can be around DKK 31 on Deliveroo, 2.2 times cheaper than with Wolt in CPH!). Also, other cities in Denmark generally have lower delivery costs.

Not like it's a big deal or anything, and I'm aware that some restaurants offer cheaper or even free delivery under certain conditions, but the vast majority does not and instead relies on food delivery services like Wolt, Just Eat, etc, who dictate high prices.",What drives food delivery prices so high up?,2.0,2.0

rubnrp,"I've been on this platform since 2008 after lurking for a few years due to seeing little need to make an account and comment. After posting something on this thread and seeing it hit the Front Page (FP), I had a bunch of oddballs sliding into my DMs trying to sleuth personal information from my post history.

This account has been used over the years to help build my professional network and make new connections in topics of interest. It is sad to see some basement dweller use that information to try to harass or manipulate emotions.

I can only imagine what women go through on a daily basis. We need Reddit to allow us to make our accounts completely private and lock down all comments/history without making a burner account to drive up their numbers and make them feel like their platform is growing.

Front Page Edit:

For those of you creeping into my profile you‚Äôre just proving my point.

Reddit has filed for S1. The company is going to go public sometime in 2022. If you think my little voice isn‚Äôt impactful, no problem. Do you know who they care about? Shareholders and investors.

Those people are going to make Reddit change and it isn‚Äôt going to be popular. Complain all you want now because change is coming.

Edit 2:

Feel free to keep using profanity and nword counts on me.

Heads up. The answer is zero. I haven‚Äôt dropped a bomb or the n word at all on any social media account. Keep swinging for the fences trolls. Maybe you‚Äôll find something?

Also, some child is making accounts just to spam and annoy me. Thank you for the free real estate in your mind. Maybe you need a life?

Lastly, this troll is trying to talk smack about my 3 month old child.

As I complete a re-watch, Meadow was way worse growing up: She trashes Livias home, she says she didn't take ecstacy but she really did, she spills pancake mix all over the stove, treats her mother worse than Livia treated green Grove (SHE WAS ABUSIVE TO THA STAAAFF), she steals Jackie Jr's car while drunk and immediately totals it, gets drunk at his funeral and throws bread at uncle Jun, runs away from her dad (the boss of this family) into a busy street. I'm sure I could go on

AJ is just a happy little boy, plays Nintendo, eats poptarts, but gets shit on by his parents constantly, it's downright abusive. His worse behavior only comes when his parents are separated and when his dad is in a coma. Plus we see as he gets older he gets the construction job, becomes manayer of the pizza place, cares for Blancas son.

Meadow grows up and reveals her own ignorance by setting herself up to becoming a mob lawyer...

s4bwmv,"I‚Äôve been thinking (while drinking) about my feelings when watching the wheel of time show and when watching the sword of truth show back in 2008. 

I started wheel of time in 9th grade when I got the first 5 books joining the Science Fiction Book Club back in the mid 90s. Loved the series and had multiple re-reads up until book 9, when my twenties and drinking got in the way. (Currently on book 5 of rereading) 

I read the first 4-5 books of sword of truth in my late teens as well. I remember liking them, even though current reviews say they are garbage. 

My point is that I enjoyed the tv series of sword of truth more than wheel of time. It was a Xena/Hercules type show that I don‚Äôt remember too well but I watched both seasons and enjoyed it for what it was. I have tried for 2 weeks to finish ep 8 of WoT and have yet to finish. There‚Äôs so much I hate about this show. I think I‚Äôd have been happier with WoT if it got the xena/Hercules treatment instead of having such high expectations of the most prominent story of my lifetime that‚Äôs been with me for 28 years.

Regardless, can‚Äôt wait to finish the books. Read Shadow Rising in 2 weeks. Not looking forward to the slog of the middle books, but may be able tackle them in my 40s better than in my 20s??? We shall see. If anything, the show has motivated me to finish the series.",WoT show vs SoT show,2.0,2.0

I swear some mornings I wake up craving it. One of my biggest fantasies is to be in a blowbang.

Now for the slutty part, Even though I don't get cock as much as I want I do have a backup.  I have a 7in colour suction cup dildo.  It's one of my favourite toys and it is stuck to the wall of my shower (yes I live alone) and I practice on it every time i'm in the shower.

sd541e,"I‚Äôm wondering what you think about one sided sex. Backstory - I date‚Ä¶.a lot. I‚Äôve found some partners are very into the dirty talk and almost need it to climax whilst some are super against it and it almost turns them off. 
Personally I‚Äôm not a HUGE fan but happy to participate because I‚Äôm a team player and always aim to please.. but it‚Äôs not really something that ‚Äòdoes it for me‚Äô‚Ä¶  I met a guy and last night we had sex for the first time. The sex started off great until he started shouting at me asking me to call him Richard (that was not even his name). So I did, a little shocked at the voice level but I did as he asked THEN he started repeating over and over for me to tell him he has the biggest cock I‚Äôve ever seen and blah blah, again I obliged but he wouldn‚Äôt let up even though I was saying it. He would just shout really loud, randomly for me to say things to him and I guess after a while I felt like I was just speaking when he asked but he wasn‚Äôt listening, he was just getting off on his own voice. Very full on and very annoying. Again I don‚Äôt have an issue with the dirty talk, even dirty yelling I guess but this was another level.

5. Not to mention how he treated her when she told him she was pregnant, like it was her fault.

6. And the worst part of all; after he was raped in his college room; he practically raped her too! He treated her like shit, and he took revenge for what they did to him with her body.

sbsd76,"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriarchal_bargain

Like many women on FDS I observed that, despite what liberal feminist culture and TV says, women who have sex outside of deeply committed traditional relationships where the man provides financially, are often scorned as ‚Äúwhores‚Äù and ‚Äúcrazy/broken‚Äù, and devalued as relationship partners, often both by so-called liberal and conservative men. 

Society blames the woman for single parenthood even when the father abandoned the family. 

A woman‚Äôs main value to a relationship is often voiced by misogynistic (both liberal and conservative men) as being her looks and her interest in having sex with him regularly. 

The conditions we date in are  punishing to women for deviating from traditional relationships (men don‚Äôt seem to consistently respect or value the 50/50 chick, the casual sex chick or the ‚Äúcareer chick‚Äù deep down and it shows-to be fair misogynistic men don‚Äôt truly respect or value ANY woman even if she is a perfect barefoot pregnant church girl)‚Ä¶while simultaneously scorning women in traditional relationships as ‚Äúgold diggers‚Äù and ‚Äúlazy‚Äù (for wanting to stay home with children and be provided for). No matter what women do, misogynists hate it and hate us. 

Like many women who awakened to this on FDS I began to really believe that liberal feminism lies to women and that the end goal of it was sexual liberation - FOR MEN. LVM Men getting as much sex as possible for the lowest financial and social investment possible, then complaining and hating us for it, is the exact degeneracy libfem promotes. Being a libfem pickme is basically to be a fool and get played by men with nothing to show for it at the end. I‚Äôve never had sexual intercourse outside of an LTR relationship but even just kissing with someone you have been on several dates with can carry social punishment.

Is FDS itself a patriarchal bargain? I believe it evokes conservative patterns like the man paying for everything as a way of leveling compensation for the unequal risk we take by dating men. We can be assaulted, get pregnant, have years of our life wasted by men who have no intention of marrying us, but simultaneously be called a picky bitch when we leave him after 2+ years being the gf to find a man who WILL love to deeply commit and invest in our and our baby‚Äôs future. 

FDS is the taboo idea that women should play to win (hopefully win-win is the idea for most of us). But there is always going to be the fact that we live in a society where men are regarded as full human beings but women are stereotypes.

Honestly all the impossible double standards of being wrong no matter what you do, is why I just gave up on dating men entirely, for many years. There was a recent OP about how once LVM men have sex with you, they feel like they ‚Äúhave you‚Äù and stop trying to court you or in the case of Madonna whore complex, Peter Pan syndrome, masculinity crisis/insecurity, porn sickness or misogyny, sex causes them even to HATE the woman and hate her attachment  and vulnerability. It‚Äôs like we get punished for daring to like/love them back, which betrays the commonality of dismissive- avoidant attachment in men - wanting to be close to them equals disgust and repulsion to THEM which is insanely dysfunctional socially.

No further information is required.  You do NOT want to give your boss ANY details about your personal life.   Trust me, they will use anything they learn  to manipulate and influence you.

I enjoyed some of it quite a bit--my main issues are what they did to Lan and the trainwreck of a finale, but the point of this post wasn't to get into my criticisms so deeply.   I sympathize with everyone here however regardless of where we may disagree.

I just finished watching the live Cowboy Bebop remake on Netflix and I loved it. Sure it wasn't perfect, it was corny and campy but it was straightforward about it, and damn if it wasn't entertaining.  

Some great acting, entertaining fight scenes, no qualms with the CGI/space scenes/etc.  Compared to wheel of time, frankly I thought it looked better, held together better, and had far less obviously bad writing.  I was really surprised at how badly it was reviewed, but on reading the official/published reviews, it seemed they were all written by huge fans of the anime who hated the adaptation as having missed the soul of the original. 

Since I haven't seen the original and am not a fan of anime in general, I can't argue with this.  But I was struck so much with how all of the Bebop reviews were clearly written by fans, whereas none of the Wheel of Time official reviews were.  

I visited the cowboy bebop subreddit and it reads eerily similar to this one; the difference being that I found their criticisms to seem unnecessarily nitpicky and baffling to me (but of course, I don't know the original).  On the post that it had been cancelled after one season, the response was probably how I would imagine this group responding to similar news.  It made me wonder--is this how we (book originalists) seem to show-only watchers?  I pondered but still, for me, the fact remains that I think the live Cowboy Bebop is just a better show than WoT all around and IT WASN'T TRYING TO TOP GOT, ONE OF THE GREATEST SHOWS OF ALL TIME.  It just made me frustrated all over that, for how high Amazon's ambitions were, we got such a mediocre product (or god-awful, if you prefer).

I live in Idaho in a RV that doesn‚Äôt have heat. I had a workplace accident and lost my left leg. My ex wife decided she was no longer attracted to me so we got a divorce. She got the house and I got the RV. My son just turned 7 and for his birthday all he asked for was to spend more time with me.


He even went so far as to ask that if he got enough money for his birthday from his mom and her side of the family, could we get a hotel room to hangout. His mom said he didn‚Äôt ask for toys, just money. I obviously didn't let that happen and it really crushed me that he just wants to be with me and can‚Äôt. Also my ex just had her new boyfriend move in and my son sends me texts all day that he doesn‚Äôt like him.


I discussed this with my ex and she said ‚Äúwell if you could afford a motel or apartment you can have him all you want‚Äù. My son thinks that because I don‚Äôt have a pace, I don‚Äôt want him around. Which is absolutely not it at all. Kids don‚Äôt understand grown up problems. When I do get him we usually walk around a store and window shop or hit up the mall food court.


Once it warms up I will be able to keep him overnight and there will be more for us to do outside. He is going through a big change with his mom's relationship getting serious. I want him to know I‚Äôm not going anywhere and that I want nothing more than to spend as much time as possible with him.

I know she's had open relationships in the past, but ours has so far been exclusive. It was a vulnerable moment for her so I didn't want to ask too many questions, but I now find myself wondering if/how this will affect our monogamous relationship. I guess what I'm asking is, for those of you poly folks, how do you approach monogamous relationships? what are some of the struggles and difficulties I should be aware of? Is it viable, in your experience, to have a monogamous relationship as a poly person? Also wanna clarify that I have no issues with polyamory, I was just kind of thrown for a loop when she came out to me today and I'm looking for answers.","TLDR: partner came out as poly, looking to understand her side of things",2.0,2.0

ryp8m4,"We had a crisis in our relationship of 10 years, everything went downhill on new years eve, she got really drank (again) lied to my face about leaving the party to call someone, and the next day she says that she don't remember anything about it. I was hurt, I saw who she has been calling that night but she said that was just her friend, and I really wanted to belive that. 

It was a ruff week, but I had a sliver of hope that maybe we will get through this. However that ""friend"" was still bugging me. I wanted to get past that and did something very wrong, and here I am, can't sleep in middle of night because I checked here phone and find out theirs text on whatsapp. About how they love each other, how she want to have his kids, that they spent the night together...

One is clear, I can not be with her anymore. She is sleeping in another bedroom, and I don't know if I should wake her up, or wait till morning. We live in my house at suburbs, she don't drive, and don't have any other way to leave in 4 a.m. and I'm to devastated to talk with her for next 4 hours. I just want that she dissappear from my life.

Help

Update:

I woke her up, confronted her about that texts, asked for how long they are meeting up. And what I got for an answer? Questions like what do you mean, why do you think that? And I fucking felt empty.. She started blaming me, asked why I checked her phone. That I didn't care for us. I showed her those texts, their photos together and still no word from her that would be close I'm sorry... absolute denial. 

Told her to pack her things and that if her new boyfriend don't want to pick her up I will gladly drive her whenever she wants. She says that she don't have a boyfriend, and I was really struggling to not call her names at that moment. Instead I just said that if she don't have a boyfriend it only means that she is single now. Because I can't be with someone who cheated on me and still tell lies in my face anymore. And she said no she will not pack her things on 4 a.m. and seriously I get that, she acted like bitch, but be woken up in middle of night, and start pack your things is awful. But the tone that she said that, I literally wanted to scream.. like nothing happened and tomorrow everything would be allright.

Then I just said that she can go to sleep and pack in the morning that I don't care anymore as long she leaves. Went up to bedroom and writing thus from my phone.

Update 2:

She came back from smoke, came to my room and sat on bed I'm laying. Said ""forgive me"" couple of times. I just said that I can't be with someone that cheated on me. And she is like ""I wasn't cheating for 10 year, don't throw it way"". I'm speechless.

Update 3:

She packed her stuff, I guess then she realized what's going on. Came to me crying and begging for forgiveness, another chance. Spoke that she wasn't that bad, and that he means nothing to her. That she love me.. It was rough.. still I only felt sorry for her, nothing more. Her friend picked her up. And  now im alone in a big house bought to start a family.. it sucks. It's 8AM its  timeto go to bed.

rxh0qs,"Hi guys I'm high gold low plat main voli that plays him primarly in the jungle. I restarted almost one tricking voli in this preseason and I have some ideas/questions.

About runes :
I always run the same runes. PTA over lethal because I think it's better especially in early duels. Then I go Triumph, tenacity and last stand (obviously). As second tree I always go conditionning ans revitalize because I just really dont see a reason to not take them. I then go AS, AD and health. I go Armor instead of health if mid-jungle is full AD.

About items :
Now here is the real tricky part. First of all I'm really not a fan of AP voli I just find him too squishy. For mythic I usually go Frost, or Sunfire if they're heavy melee. I dont think Frost is good coz voli already has a Cc and a slow but it gives nice resistances (especially with conditionning) and extra health. I'm not a fan of sunderer since Voli doesnt really use it in teamfight (i feel he's more of a burst kind of champ) and I see th√© VERY HIGH potential of trinity but I just feel too squishy with it and tend to int because of it lol. Second item is always sterak and after it changes. Tank items (u know them), Tita Hydra if I'm good in the game or Clever if they're is more than 2 tanks/ people build Armor a lot.

Questions :
Thats where I have questions. I like dealing damage and having carry potential hense the fact I dont go full tank and I believe Volibear isnt the best scaling champ but he's still relevant util the end if you go bruiser. But I do feel like I dont deal enough damage. I was thinking of maybe building berserker or essence river but I'm afraid it's just int. What do you guys think?

sd854p,"A bit over six months ago, I posted a [poll](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/ob5orp/oc_demographics_and_positions_on_the_peace/) on several subreddits with some demographic and political questions, followed by a roundup of preferred resolutions toward peace in the Israel / Palestine. Almost 300 of you responded to that poll, and I decided to update and extend it, and publish it to a broader community of subreddits twice per year.

I've found that the Ramallah-based [Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research](http://www.pcpsr.org/) conducts excellent, ongoing polls of Israeli Jews, Arab citizens of Israel, and Palestinian Arabs in the WB and Gaza -- these have consistently been a resource to me in thinking about this issue, discussing it, and testing my own biases and preconceptions.

With that in mind, I've done my best to model my questions off of some I found in their [""Joint Israeli Palestinian Pulse""](http://www.pcpsr.org/sites/default/files/Table%20of%20findings_English%20Joint%20Poll%20%20Oct%202020.pdf). Reddit's poll interface is a little bit clunky, so I've [**posted the poll here.**](https://surveyking.com/w/qjx8m56)

The poll focuses on collecting background information, then proceeds through a series of questions focused on understanding your perspective on the best next steps in resolving the conflict.

Along the way, you'll see several sets of questions:

* Your demographics and political tendencies
* Your opinions on Israelis and Palestinians
* Your highest priorities for outcomes from the future
* Your support for various solutions (a one state solution, two state solution, etc)
* If you described yourself as 'pro-Palestine' or 'pro-Israel', your willingness to see your side make a specific series of concessions as part of a peace deal

[TAKE THE POLL](https://surveyking.com/w/qjx8m56)

Edit: One user has (vehemently) disagreed with my use of the term 'Israeli Arabs' in the paragraph above. It's not used in the poll, and I've edited it to 'Arab citizens of Israel' in the paragraph above.

I (22f) have constant incestuous thoughts.
I grew up in a very nice family without any problems. I have 4 older siblings and we all grew up very nicely. My parents both have nice jobs and all my siblings went to college and currently work. There is no record of any neglect or abuse in our family and our parents really raise us nicely. As far as I‚Äôm aware of, there is also no record of any mental illnesses or those kind of stuff. I‚Äôve also never been bullied, abused, assaulted or anything and I get along nicely with everyone in my family.

I am currently a college student and my life is pretty good. My only issue is that I constantly have some thoughts about sex and they always are family-related. It‚Äôs 24/7 and I can‚Äôt stop thinking about it. I‚Äôm not gonna go into details about those thoughts because that‚Äôs so disgusting but it‚Äôs about all my family members (parents and siblings) and it‚Äôs so freaking gross. That‚Äôs ruining my life, I‚Äôm so sick of thinking about that. 
I‚Äôve never did anything sexual with anyone in my family, I don‚Äôt even think that I want to do so, I just think about that without wanting this to be real.
I‚Äôve also never slept with anyone and I‚Äôm never going to. I rarely masturbate cause every time I do I think about them and the feeling of thinking about your family when you orgasm is disgusting. I disgust myself.
I can‚Äôt talk about that to anyone, not even a therapist. I thought about killing myself to stop those thoughts but my life is pretty good beside that and I still have things to live. I don‚Äôt know what to do. This is disgusting",I constantly have incestuous thoughts,2.0,2.0

s01iuo,"## Game 25. Turn 8. Witch Hunts

Battles against demons continued throughout the century. Ba Dum Tash created a new Priesthood, the orcish Thunder Warriors, and reclaimed his defiled shrine in the Mountains of the Tail, turning it once more to a place of mirth, cheer, and NOISE!  

The Ten Lords of Sin however sought to capitalize on the loss of Haian Hars Ydd, by opening a great rift in the Ysin Mountains. Let loose, their weakness of Bhukhara Steel would be extiniguished, and the godless Yrk‚Äôs fierce will would be similarly broken.  

Yet other gods did not stand by such horrors. Instead, Ghiasabe, the knowledgeable icy goddess, wove a new, fiercer weakness for the invading demons- that shadow and darkness itself would hurt and burn Demons, forcing the deceivers to stick to the light. Meanwhile the great Thunder Warriors of Ba Dum Tash took battle to the invading Demons, weaving a great song ritual to seal the portals of the Pit and close the great rift. For now.  

Nhoa and the Hua meanwhile focussed on loss instead. A new cult, The God Seekers worked a magic to crystallize the memories and ideas in Yom‚Äôs Dreams to a quasi divine of sorts. Now, a hollow remnant of Haian has been kindled, connecting to comfort and reinforce what priests still cling to his Will. The Will of the Yrk stands strong once more, but this new ritual seeds ideas across the world.     

The City continued to improve itself, with its citizens easily taking control of their entire planetoid by advanced weaponry and intellect. While much of the worlds deals in magic, steel and arrows, the City now works in mass production, electronics, whirring machines, and bright lights!

The work of the titans continued in starts and stops. Their unleashed Giants were able to rampage freely, often slaughtering magic users, and so the next generation has less magicians and shamans than previous ones.  

Venita attempted to succour the final brain shard from Doldar, but thanks to Veles‚Äô warnings, Doldar and Erldur suspect evil motives from the Cloud Titaness. Sip Tayif played games in the Spiral, where Passion won a strange map from them, and the Stone Titan dug a great rift in the Garden, seeking the Heart of Yom.       

Brain, Heart and Dreams. Which will come to fruition?

## Events

### Crisis: Stealing Dreamers     

Once scattered and aimless, the Colossi have become surprisingly coordinated, and many have taken command of wild tribes of Yomlings. Now the huge giants work to abduct and sacrifice those closest to magic in the world, those who have great dreams and vivid moments. Their tribes often use Wild Magic recklessly, manifesting spells from any lore at random, while the Colossi themselves are resistant to magic, but too numerous for the gods to simply hunt them down, as the Stone and Brine titan often make more.          

If left unchecked, these raids and wars may weaken the civilizations of the world, lowering their Tech level. Detail how your divines or mortals face these raids to avoid such regression.              

### Prompt: Reshaping the Map

How has the landscape your divine shaped changed since its creation? Do mortals completely cover and tame the land with arable pastures, or hunker within their limited towns?

s0ugr8,"My husband and I have been together for almost 7 years now, married 3. He's amazing, and we have always gotten along so well. He's attentive, loyal, everything I look for in a husband. We have a daughter turning 2 in a couple weeks and he is the most amazing father. He loves spending time with her and he has no problem taking care of her despite working all day and he's even renovating our new house right now.

Only one problem. I'm always the one initiating sex and lately I'm getting rejected more and more often. I don't even ask for it that often anymore because I'm afraid of rejection. Even thinking back to the beginning of our relationship we had a lot of sex but it was almost always me initiating, just be didn't reject me as much as now. I went right back to my pre baby body literally within days and I look the same as when we met so I haven't changed physically. I just feel so lonely and I'm craving intimacy. It got even worse after our daughter was born and I'm worried he is only seeing me in this mothering role now. 
The other night I put on some lingerie from our honeymoon and he went along with having sex but I just had this feeling he wasn't that into it. I could even tell he was starting to lose his erexrion at one point which I think has only happened once in the entire time we've been together, and that was only because we were drinking. I'm just so tired of being rejected and feeling unattractive. I want to feel wanted! Even just some flirting during the day would be nice! 

At night he is always working on his laptop until about 20 minutes before he's ready to go to bed and then he'll come to the couch and rest his head on me because it how he likes to fall asleep. I just realised tonight that is something a mother would do!

I feel like there is some madonna/whore complex going on and I don't know what to do. I don't want to tell him that, but I just don't know how to get him to see me as a mother and wife but also a sexual being.",What to do if my husband seems to have a Madonna/whore complex?,2.0,2.0

ru1wo4,"As always, my stories are 100 percent true and during my 20s while I was not with my significant other. I was living in the city in a 1 bedroom apartment and recently graduated from college. I was recently single and very recently started playing while dressing up, usually using CL. I had the most amount of clothes, heels, wigs, make-up, and lingerie that I have ever owned since being in my apt and I could not wait to dress up in a new city and finally being brave enough to meet guys while crossdressed. 

One night, I was walking home from work around 8:00pm and decided that I was going to shave and get all girly for the night, probably flirt a little bit online and then go to bed. Planning out my night in my head, I looked over and noticed a car driving very slow and a guy yelling out his window. I was currently in guy mode and had my headphones on, so I just kept walking on. The car kept up with my pace and I decided to look over again. I saw a black dude my age in his 20's looking at me trying to say something so I took off my headphones and walked to the car. He said what's up and asked if I was Japanese by any chance, in which I nodded my head. He said that Japanese people all look very nice and then got real quiet.

I am not into guys while in guy mode so I was pretty creeped out and started to back away. The guy smiled and said asked if he could possibly see my feet, I was currently wearing some sneakers. I laughed a little and told him I didn't think so, in which he said please, he loved how Japanese feet looked. He said he would give me $50 to see my feet, and as a broke dude, I started thinking about it. He said that I could sit in his car and he would just look at them. The guy kept asking and I started getting nervous and broke and started to take off my shoe. As I was talking off my shoe, someone passed me on the sidewalk, which scared me and I quickly put my shoe back on and left. I took the nearest left and started walking down the street, nervous and excited at the same time. I started walking down and noticed that the same car turned down the street.

This street was much quieter and he quickly drove up and asked why I got so scared. He pulled over and asked if I was interested and I said ok. I was nervous, turned on, and on my guard all at once. I got into the passenger's seat and left the door open. I took off my left shoe and my sock, and quickly remembered that I had a little polish left on my toes. When he saw my foot, he said he was turned on and then asked why I was wearing nail polish. I told him that I was a crossdresser, something I have never told anyone in person before, but I figured this was a unique situation and fuck it. He said that cds really turn him on and asked if I could dress up for him. At this point, I am pretty turned on and I told him to park and that I would come back in 20 mins dressed up. I was pretty close to my apt, so I got out and told him it was worth it. He said that I better come back and I told him that there was one way to find out.

I walked 5 mins to my apt and quickly changed into some lingere. I checked my body, which was hairless and put on some make up in 5 mins. I put on a short hot pink dress, my breast forms, some black stockings and garter and checked myself out in the mirror. I decided on a long black wig and some teal high heels with very high heels. I put the heels and the wig in a backpack, and put on some sweatpants, and a sweatshirt with a hood on to cover up my girl clothes. I put on some shoes and put the hood on to cover my face and walked out the door with my bag. I was super turned on and could feel starting to get that feeling when I was about to suck cock, excited, nervous, ashamed, and naughty. I went to my parking garage, got into the car and drove back to the street where I saw his car parked. 

I pulled over real quick and took off my sweatpants to reveal my dress and my legs in the car. I was so nervous as I put my heels on my feet. I then took off my sweatshirt and put on my wig from my bag. I looked in the mirror and combed my wig and took a deep breathe. I remember getting out of the car and heading the sound of my heels hitting the concrete and the clicking they made. I felt so girly and super slutty as I walked to his car. I walked to the door and opened it and saw his mouth drop. He said I looked like a sexy Asian slut and told me that he knew I wanted to suck his cock when I saw him. He told me to say yes and I did ashamed. He said that I was gonna suck his cock like the girl I am and that I would like it. I nodded as he lowered his shorts and revealed his cock, which was one of the biggest I have seen at the time. He then called me a bitch and told me to suck. 

I put my head down and took his dick in his mouth, gagging for a sec as I take in the taste. I started going faster and faster as he started moaning and calling me a good girl. I remember thinking how crazy this situation was and how much I loved sucking as I took his cock. I started feeling him pulse in my mouth and he said he was about to bust. He told me to open wide and I just remember opening my mouth wide with my tongue out and eyes closed. Right when I closed my eyes, I felt a huge spray of cum that went all over my face and into my mouth. Just when I released what happened, the guy put his shorts back up, threw me a $20 bill and told me to get the fuck out. He said he only gave me $20 because he didn‚Äôt last long and I didn‚Äôt have to work hard. 

I opened the door, grabbed my keys, and walked back to my car as he pulled off. I remember walking faster and looking down at my heels to my car and opened the door as quick as possible. I grabbed my clothes from my bag and took off my wig and put on my sweatshirt and hood. Took off my heels and put my sweatpants on with my sneakers and wiped my face with a napkin. I remember sitting there, realizing that I just took a huge risk, and being so turned on as i started my car. I quickly went back to my apt and walked in and sat in my bed. I remember taking off my outside clothes and feeling so ashamed and yet I was super turned on I decided to take care of that as I turned the shower on to wash my night off me not knowing what to think about the $20 I just made.",I've never been more nervous or more excited in my life,2.0,2.0

as someone who finds comfort in her character and relates a little too much to her storyline, i need to defend her.

rue introduced her with the words ‚Äúshe fell in love with every guy she ever dated‚Äù: cassie strongly seeks male validation because of her absent father. since she is seen as a sex object rather than a human, she feeds into this as it appears to be the only reason someone would like her. although most people argue that it DOESNT make people like her, in her mind it‚Äôs the only thing that interests men and she will do anything to hold their attention.

and when it comes to nate/maddy, yes it is upsetting that she would sleep with someone who treated her best friend so terribly, but it‚Äôs not that simple. nate is a master manipulator who is using cassie‚Äôs vulnerability to get when he wants, while we don‚Äôt know exactly what he wants yet (whether he‚Äôs doing it to get to maddy or not), it is cruel to assume this this is all cassie‚Äôs doing and not just a reaction to his manipulation.

1 in 10 people with uteruses have uterine tissue that grows in the wrong place, i.e., outside of their uterus. This tissue still bleeds every month, except there‚Äôs no exit point, so you bleed internally. 

It can cause lesions and can adhere your organs together over time. This can result in excruciating periods, recurring pain in other areas, and infertility. There is no known cause and there is no cure.  Many doctors don‚Äôt take it seriously, or say, ‚Äútry some ibuprofen.‚Äù

**Rule 1:** The album must consist of 12 songs with an additional 2 bonus tracks for a special Target exclusive edition of the album.

**Rule 2:** Do not worry about putting their most popular songs on the album, unless you want to.

**Rule 3:** The 14 songs should be your own personal favorite Twenty One Pilots songs.

**Rule 4:** You are allowed to only have 4 tracks at most from Self-Titled/Regional at Best/No Phun Intended because Fueled by Ramen does not own the rights to those releases. (I am sorry about this one but realistically, Fueled by Ramen would not put any songs from those releases on this album).

**Rule 5:** Please pretend like this is in a universe where Heathens doesn‚Äôt exist

I dont see any responsibility taken when it comes to the core problem, which is the goddamn leverage. You guys are screwing us all over with these liquidations.

The most loyal long term holders getting screwed because of your greed? How the fuck is that ok? People who got liquidated will get a refund and investors with a good sense pay the price? And i dont mean the treasury, i mean the devaluation of wMEMO and TIME, thats what we pay. 

You guys are not realizing that you making as all look like goddamn clowns when the treasury manager and the co founder gets liquidated on their own project? With this greedy behavior you‚Äôre actively helping to make your own community lose money. Thanks  A responsible answer would be that you and all devs would declare that you wont leverage your positions on this project anymore. You guys are all multi-millionaires, but still feel the need to risk it on our backs? We pay the price in the end, but Abracadabra keeps on making money with this irresponsible behavior, very frog nation like aint it? 

And i strongly oppose to pay even 1 fucking dollar from the treasury to anyone who got liquidated None of them would ve shared the profits with us, why would we share their losses? The automated buy back didnt worked? Well that was your job guys and you get paid very well so take responsibility for god's sake.

s1e677,"Do we actually ‚Äúlove‚Äù crypto?

I think not. We say that we ‚Äúlove‚Äù crypto. But we also say that we ‚Äúlove‚Äù hotdogs and hamburgers. We ‚Äúlove‚Äù our mums and dads. We ‚Äúlove‚Äù our dogs and cats. How can this be? How do we share the ‚Äúlove‚Äù?

Turns out we‚Äôve been wrong all along. Rather, the English language has been wrong all along. English is pretty much the language of confounding words. The rules simply don‚Äôt apply in many cases. 

Let‚Äôs look at the Greek language of which you all will already have some understanding as I explain. The Greek language has many forms and expressions of love and they all have different meanings. 

For example: Philadelphia. What does it mean? It means the City of Brotherly Love. What does it mean in the Greek? A brotherly love. Phileo

How about Eros? Eros is an erotic or sexual love. 

Storge. Storge is a deep love of family. 

And then we have an Agape love. This is the love that we all need above and beyond all others. It‚Äôs a love that knows no boundaries. It‚Äôs an all consuming love that breaks all barriers. It‚Äôs a love that describes that I am going to love you no matter what. No matter what you‚Äôve done to me, I am still going to love you. 

I don‚Äôt know who in this community needs to hear this this morning, but you are loved. Our infinity with crypto is not love. We should at all times have an understanding of our investments and how they affect our lives. Money is powerful. It is time consuming. To earn it, we must work jobs that we sometimes do not like or days that our shift will never end.

This isn't a new feeling by any means, but maybe it was amplified as I just watched Season 13 episode 8, ""The Room Where it Happens"". Meredith is horrible in that episode. She is a snappy bitch with no logic the whole time. She pulls rank without even giving a shit about the patient. Even in her flashback, she was just unlikeable.

rujo96,"I think Lewis and other men trying to explain Why a woman would stop participating in at that she personally enjoys they are not doing a great job. When a woman thinks about a certain sexual act like blow jobs or anal, She thinks if she actively enjoys these acts with one partner, why would she stop with another partner? Why would less attraction stop a woman from enjoying herself? They miss explaining this point:


The woman fucked up so hard financially or let herself be socially pressured to marry a man she has  ZERO attraction to. It‚Äôs not less attracted it‚Äôs NO ATTRACTION. she doesn‚Äôt want to do any sex acts at all. She doesn‚Äôt want to receive oral or have PIV just as much as she doesn‚Äôt want to give a BJ or get fucked in the butt. But, on a scale of acceptability to placate her beta‚Ä¶.Once a month she can chug two big glasses of wine and lay on her back or stomach in the dark so he can‚Äôt see her eyes closed and let him hammer away hoping that he will finish quickly. That‚Äôs what these guys mean. It also sounds like a torturous existence. Women have had to endure for thousands of years. fortunately do not have to anymore.

I told my husband I needed to a do a few things and was going to meet up with a friend later so I would out most of the day, Early afternoon I went to the toilet with the glory hole I was planning to hang around there for some time to see what happened. I was wearing a dress and took my panties off in the car.

  
I was sitting on the toilet and browsing my phone for about 20mins thinking maybe no one will come this time so I should just go but i wanted to suck a strangers cock.

  
About 10mins later the door opens and closed and my heart started pounding a min later a cock comes through the hole. I was so happy to see it I licked sucked and I heard give me your pussy I was so wet and horny I turned around and put my pussy to the hole and felt him enter me he fucked me until he came inside me without warning and he left.

  
I was I shock and just sat there processing what just happened when another man came in and a couple mins later a cock in the hole i sucked and swallowed.  
thinking I should leave now and another guy came in? whoa I thought has someone told people I'm in here? again I sucked and he was very talkative calling me all dirty names and calling me a slut and I am.

  
he left and I was so turned on I fingered myself still feeling cum inside me I thought I better wait a while before leaving when door opened again another cock in the hole and very big i gaged on his cock which he liked to hear me gag which turned me on so much and made me so wet he didn't ask but I turned around and offered my pussy and he fucked me roughly and also came inside me without warning. he came alot.

  
4 guys I had to leave no my mouth was sore and my pussy also. When another came through the hole just a small cock much older man I think i sucked him and he was being sweet and calling me a good girl he came and left.

  
I couldn't wait any longer I had to leave 5 guys was already to many. I rushed to my car my heart was pounding. I am really a disgusting slut the worst of the worst but I loved it.",31 f I am disgusting slut... i went back to the glory hole,1.0,2.0

rxnwho,"After watching Four Lives on BBC One over the last couple of days, I wanted to express my deepest empathy and compassion towards the families that lost loved ones during these times and hope and pray that these families are able to heal from the pain of these situations and find light and happiness in their lives. I very rarely cry, it really takes a lot to make me cry, and the ending of the program touched me yesterday and had me sobbing because I felt so much pain of what these families must have gone through and can't imagine how traumatic the whole situation must have been.

I also wanted to express my gratitude towards the families that shared their stories and contributed towards getting this programme on the TV as I deeply hope that after people watch this, that something will be done about the way the police force operates and I hope that this programme puts into perspective how many of us have been let down, neglected and unprotected by the police and I hope that from this moment forward, that those of us in society that are vulnerable, such as the LGBTQ community, black people, Women, Asian people, Jewish people, disabled people, mentally ill people, are able to rely on the police and the legal system, fully, and receive the protection and support that we have lacked and so desperately needed for many, many years. I hope that more is done to prevent these things from happening and that these situations can be avoided rather than things being left and ignored until someone is hurt or loses their life.

More needs to be done to protect vulnerable communities and to protect everybody else as well and I hope that one day, we can all stand strong and fight together to so that our voices are heard and so that society are provided with the defense, protection, support and power that we need rather than being neglected and forgotten about. 

As I have also experienced lack of help from Redbridge police, I have been trying and trying to get my voice and concerns and complaints heard by the police and trying to make a difference and make a change so that more is done to arrest criminals and so that more effort is made to put away violent, dangerous individuals and make Essex a safer, environment with a strong, determined, hardworking police presence that is devoted to protecting and preserving the life of others, but on my own, my voice is not loud enough and I'm not being heard and I feel that we need to come together as a society and make our voices louder and make our voices heard so that positive changes can be made that will ensure we CAN rely on the police and to ensure that we WILL be protected and to ensure that we can make this a BETTER place, with less violence, less assaults, less crime, less risk to peoples lives.

I hope that there will be some of you that would be willing to raise our concerns about negligence within our local police force and our concerns that we are not safe and not protected and have our voices heard until changes are made for the benefit and safety of our society.

If any of you have complaints or concerns with how the police have dealt with some of your issues and you are from the Redbridge area and you too, want changes to be made so that more effort is made to protect us, please get in contact with me, as I feel that these issues should be raised with the head of police and the MP and to take this even further if our complaints aren't dealt with, if we raise our voices together, we might have a better chance of making a difference. 

If you are not from Redbridge, but located within Essex and have received neglect and lack of help and protection from the police as well, please contact me too, every voice matters and every voice makes a difference

I'm not totally comfortable with it, if I'm honest. Do girls actually like these things, or do they think they're somehow doing it for my benefit? If I say I don't like it, will they say ""oh thank god neither do I"" or will they think I'm a being a bitch?

Edit: OK, looks like some girls like it, some don't. I'm not totally comfortable with it, but it's not a dealbreaker for me so I'll probably just continue doing it when asked.

Price increases are a worry, but name something that has not gone up in price lately? We're two years into a global health crisis. Insisting on ""business as usual"" at this time is insane. Nothing is normal. A trip to the local supermarket to see empty shelves is all it takes to get some perspective on this. The whole point of Twenty21 was to drag cannabis into the mainstream in the hope that we could get it via the NHS. 

Whether or not the NHS picks up the tab we will see. The UK public are against it. As are most physicians. We have a long way to go.

So yes, Eve had me as a teenager, but Mom and Dad adopted and raised me. Mom(68F ‚Ä†)  passed away 2 years ago from breast cancer, and Dad had a heart attack 13 months ago and died 11 months ago after 2 months in ICU. In their will, our parents left me 35% of the assets and 30% to Eve and Anna each and gifted 5% to welfare organization, also they had a No-contest clause. Eve and Anne wanted to leave me out of the inheritance and contested the will, they argued that I am a Grandchild and should not inherit, because every other grandchild was left out. But I am a full Legal child by adoption, so I am equally entitled to the inheritance, which caused them to lose the contest. Where I live, that means you lose every inheritance if the will is Valid and your claims are unsuccessful. That has made me the only one who had inherited everything.

Eve and Anna are now stressing me and try to guilt-trip me, they have calculated the money and had made many purchases ,in believe they would be able to pay off their debts. Well, if they wouldn't have contest and loose, each of them would inherit about 3.4Million USD, but now they have nothing.

I am very pissed of how they treated me in the whole process, they literally tried to deny that Dad and Mom were my Parents and had a lot of phrases which they used. I told them that I can't care less for them anymore, and they will get nothing from me, I would rather build a pile of money and burn it as a campfire.

rzh7xa,"I rewatched a video by Upper Echelon Gaming (UEG) and since I started playing Mobile Legends and Wild Rift, I've had a very ü§® look towards that video now. 

It's about how Casuals are ruining games. The filthy casuals as he calls them. 

Now to my point, does playing Mobile Legends and Wild Rift make one a casual? 

Now according to UEG, a gamer or rather a hardcore gamer is someone who is willing to spend money, time and effort to better their skills and their tactics and their character in a long period of time and the way I see mobile MOBAs, that's exactly what a lot of players do. 

If you didn't know, Asia especially Southeast Asia is poor as fuck to afford huge gaming rigs and only a few can actually afford it. What the rest of the population can afford are mobile devices and with it the aforementioned Mobile games. 

We have teams and competitions about it. 

Now this poses a question, a question within a question, question-ception. I apologize for my dry humor. 

So the questions, is the existence of a mobile market where the majority of the population can only play on mobile a threat to gaming in general? And there's a freaking lot of them. A lot of those people who play in their mobile devices. 

So I appreciate any insight on this matter. 

Thank you and have a pleasant day.

ruvu1k,"This weekly roundup thread is intended for all culture war posts. ['Culture war'](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Culture_war&oldid=963768354) is vaguely defined, but it basically means controversial issues that fall along set tribal lines. Arguments over culture war issues generate a lot of heat and little light, and few deeply entrenched people ever change their minds. This thread is for voicing opinions and analyzing the state of the discussion while trying to optimize for light over heat.

Optimistically, we think that [engaging with people you disagree with](http://archive.is/LuQ66) is worth your time, and [so is being nice!](http://archive.is/hH3VO) Pessimistically, there are many dynamics that can lead discussions on Culture War topics to become unproductive. There's a human tendency to divide along tribal lines, praising your ingroup and vilifying your outgroup - and if you think you find it easy to criticize your ingroup, then it may be that your outgroup is [not who you think it is](http://archive.is/ur3Fh). Extremists with opposing positions can [feed off each other](http://archive.is/FtI4S), highlighting each other's worst points to justify their own angry rhetoric, which becomes in turn a new example of bad behavior for the other side to highlight.

We would like to avoid these negative dynamics. Accordingly, we ask that you do not use this thread for waging the Culture War. Examples of waging the Culture War:

* Shaming.     
* Attempting to 'build consensus' or enforce ideological conformity.     
* Making sweeping generalizations to vilify a group you dislike.     
* Recruiting for a cause.     
* Posting links that could be summarized as 'Boo outgroup!' Basically, if your content is 'Can you believe what Those People did this week?' then you should either refrain from posting, or do some very patient work to contextualize and/or [steel-man](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Steel_man) the relevant viewpoint.

In general, you should argue to understand, not to win. This thread is not territory to be claimed by one group or another; indeed, the aim is to have many different viewpoints represented here. Thus, we also ask that you follow some guidelines:

* Speak plainly. Avoid sarcasm and mockery. When disagreeing with someone, state your objections explicitly.     
* Be as precise and charitable as you can. Don't paraphrase unflatteringly.     
* Don't imply that someone said something they did not say, even if you think it follows from what they said.     
* Write like everyone is reading and you want them to be included in the discussion.

On an ad hoc basis, the mods will try to compile a list of the best posts/comments from the previous week, posted in Quality Contribution threads and archived at r/TheThread. You may nominate a comment for this list by clicking on 'report' at the bottom of the post, selecting 'this breaks r/themotte's rules, or is of interest to the mods' from the pop-up menu and then selecting 'Actually a quality contribution' from the sub-menu.

----

**Locking Your Own Posts**

Making a multi-comment megapost and want people to reply to the last one in order to preserve comment ordering? We've got a solution for you!

* Write your entire post series in Notepad or some other offsite medium. Make sure that they're long; comment limit is 10000 characters, if your comments are less than half that length you should probably not be making it a multipost series.
* Post it rapidly, in response to yourself, like you would normally.
* For each post *except the last one*, go back and edit it to include the trigger phrase `automod_multipart_lockme`.
* This will cause AutoModerator to lock the post.

You can then edit it to remove that phrase and it'll stay locked. This means that *you cannot unlock your post on your own*, so make sure you do this *after* you've posted your entire series. Also, don't lock the last one or people can't respond to you. *Also*, this gets reported to the mods, so don't abuse it or we'll either lock you out of the feature or just boot you; this feature is specifically for organization of multipart megaposts.

**My \[30F\] husband \[33M\] \[8 years\] died two months ago and I just found out he had been cheating for the past two years. \[Nov 29 2014\]**

[https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2nsf39/my\_30f\_husband\_33m\_8\_years\_died\_two\_months\_ago/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2nsf39/my_30f_husband_33m_8_years_died_two_months_ago/)

First I apologize for any english mistakes, it‚Äôs not my native language.

I lost my husband and my sister-in-law in a car accident about two months ago. We had been together for eight years, married for six. He was the light of my life, and someone I was extremely excited to spend the rest of my life with. We were compatible on so many parts, the sex life was amazing even after eight years and I still got all giggly just by thinking about him.

I think I‚Äôve coped with his death quite well. The first month was just a big shutdown, I didn‚Äôt leave the house, I hardly ate and all my time was just spent looking at our wedding video over and over. Luckily I have a great boss who understand and without hesitation gave me a four months leave.

In November I pushed myself to get out of my bubble. I‚Äôve tried to keep busy to get back to my everyday life. I‚Äôve cleaned the house, had people over for dinners, gone out for lunches and tried to be a good support for my husbands family who lost two precious family members in one day. We're all devastated, but we cry it out together and I feel we‚Äôve become even closer by being there for each other.

So as I‚Äôve been feeling better I decided to slowly look over my husbands stuff to see if there‚Äôs anything to throw out and put everything in boxes until I can manage to go through it all without crying.

That‚Äôs when I decided to access his computer to look for any important mails or such. So I checked his mail and also logged onto his Facebook account and except for over 100 goodbye messages on his wall, there was three private messages, and one was from this woman whose name I‚Äôve heard him mention a long time ago as a childhood friend.

I was so disgusted by their conversation filled with clear evidence that he had been cheating on me. It had places they agreed to meet, trips they‚Äôve made when I thought he was on business trip/trip with his friends, sexual flirts, hugs and kisses, and even declarations of love. When checking his phone there were no messages, but the last phone call was from her.

Having to confirm I called his closest friend and asked about the trips. He just paused and then apologized before telling everything. Apparently he had a crush on her in middle school and awoke old feelings when she flirted with him at a reunion two years ago. It seems a lot of our friends, even his secretary knew about it and tried to convince him to stop..

I don‚Äôt even know how to function anymore. One part of me wants to mourn for my husband, I miss him so much. I want him next to me when I go to bed, I want back our fun drives to work in the morning and I miss his warm smile. But the other part of me feels so deceived and I want nothing else but to go kick and spit on his grave until I‚Äôm satisfied.

A few days have passed, I haven‚Äôt been able to answer any phone calls or messages from his family. I know they probably don‚Äôt know and they sincerely worry for me, but I just can‚Äôt face them with the hate I have in me right now. I‚Äôm so frustrated and confused, I want him here to explain everything to me!

So I created a reddit account just to get this out of my system. I have no idea who to talk to about this, since most of our friends knew about it for some time but never told me anything. I‚Äôve never felt this alone and betrayed.

Please give me some wise words to handle this. I feel strange and confused for mourning and missing him when I at the same time hate his guts. How do I face his family? should I tell them? We just had a private funeral and in one month we‚Äôre having an open ‚Äòreception‚Äô for everyone to come to pay their respect. Now I‚Äôm worried she might come. I know it‚Äôs open for the public, but I really don‚Äôt want to meet her. Should I try and prevent it, or just skip the reception myself?

**tl;dr**: My husband died two months ago, and I found out he's been cheating on me for two years. I don't know what to do with my feelings, I can't face his family and I'm worried she'll come to the open 'reception' we're holding in a month.

**EDIT** Oh gosh, thank you everyone from the bottom of my heart for taking the time to give me advice in a difficult situation, it helps me so much just to know that you all spent some time of your life comforting me and giving me advice. I will spend my afternoon reading through everything and maybe in one or two weeks I'll post an update if I've decided what to do with the situation. A lot of people pointed out that I need counselling, and I've already booked two appointments this coming week, so I'm on it and I feel very positive towards it. Once again, thank you!

**EDIT2** Someone worried for children in the picture. He and I didn't want children so no, gladly there's no children in this situation.

I still have very confused feelings regarding my husband and right now I feel there is no way to forgive him. I try to think of the great times we had together, but I always find myself caught in the ‚ÄúHe knew what he was doing yet he smiled at me like that.‚Äù thinking. I‚Äôm working on it though, I‚Äôve already been to three counselling sessions and I go along great with my counsellor. She‚Äôs helped me a lot already and I‚Äôm so glad I took your advice to get professional help.

After speaking with my counsellor, we both agreed that to ease the burden I had about not being able to face his family, I should get away from them for a few days. I sent my in-laws a mail apologizing for not answering them in the past few days and that everything has been too much for me so I need to get away. So using that as an excuse I went on a spontaneous trip to Madeira, a destination I‚Äôve dreamt about for a long time. It was amazing, as I‚Äôd imagined and after coming home I realized it was something I needed very much.

I was ready to face my problems at once. After a lot of consideration I decided to tell my brother in law and his wife just so someone in his family know of my situation. Something I didn‚Äôt mention in the original post is that my husband's family is very important to me. I only have my big brother after dropping contact with our parents so his family has always been more like a real family to me than a ‚Äòin law‚Äôs family‚Äô. So that makes me even more worried to tell them, because I‚Äôm afraid it would put some distance between us. But at the same time I don‚Äôt have the energy to fake myself through the funeral reception for my husband as if I have the same feelings of love for him as I‚Äôve always had. Because I don‚Äôt. This way my brother in law can take me away or at least have some explanation if I were to lose it at future meetings with the family.

They both took it quite well and were immediately on my side without me having to ask for it. I apologized to them both for having revealed this about such a close family member and it was not my intention to badmouth him, but just the fact that I needed the support I could get. He said there‚Äôs nothing to apologize for, the blame is on his brother and it‚Äôs nothing I should apologize for. My brother in law is like a big bear and probably the nicest person I know, but I was still nervous telling him so I‚Äôm glad he reacted the way he did. We both agreed on waiting to tell his parents and little sister until the time is right.

I go along really well with his wife. The couple lived abroad until six months ago so I never had a good chance to meet and talk to her, but I really enjoy her company. Yesterday we went for a shopping trip and dinner and it‚Äôs been a long time since I forgot about time and just enjoyed myself.

So about the other woman. I don‚Äôt have the strength to face or even talk to her, so I decided to entrust her to his closest friend (The one who told me about her, let‚Äôs call him Alex.). Though it was a little awkward, I told him he owed me this for having kept quiet about it for so long even though I considered him a friend. He agreed and apologized sincerely. I know he‚Äôs always been a good guy, and he told me he made a big mistake but he didn‚Äôt tell because he always held onto the trust that my husband would end it with her as he said he would when Alex asked him to stop it. I‚Äôm still very angry, but he‚Äôs the only one I can trust to make sure she‚Äôs not there.

And my worries were right, because she didn‚Äôt take the phone call from Alex well. I sat along with him for the phone call and we had her on the speaker and during the whole time I was furious. He didn‚Äôt tell her I knew at first and she seriously had planned to be there at the reception right in front of me. When she wouldn‚Äôt budge even though he asked nicely that she can go to his grave but she won‚Äôt be welcomed at the reception, he told her that I knew everything.

She went quiet. Alex told her that she‚Äôs hurt me and that she should understand it‚Äôs not acceptable for her to be in my presence during the reception. What she said next was a mix of sorry, that she loved him, the rest was incoherent, and then she hung up. Alex has been trying to reach her two times since, but no answer. I think she got it that she‚Äôs not welcome, but I have already arranged for Alex and two other friends to be at the entrance to welcome people and stop her if she were to come.

And apparently she has a boyfriend since about nine months back. I‚Äôm not sure what to do about that yet, I‚Äôll deal with my own problems first.

So that was my update. I have dinner with my in-laws tonight which I‚Äôm looking forward to. Overall, I‚Äôm okay. As mentioned above, I‚Äôm still confused about my husband, but I guess time will show how I will deal with the situation. It feels good that some people around me know about my situation now so they can be there to support me and understand if I behave strange.

Thank you everyone who posted on my original post, I think I maybe read through all of your advice over four times. It was a great help in making my decision and helping me through my sadness. As many of you see, I‚Äôve used your advices. So thank you once again.

**tl;dr**: I told my brother in law and his wife about my husband's cheating. As I feared the other woman had planned to come to the reception. My husband's friend told her off. I've arranged 'security' at the reception in case.

I'm fairly certain that we all recognize this one, it's a pretty famous CYOA!

Hello everyone! I'm a long time roll20 DM looking to see how my improv and story skills are currently doing in an environment where I can also tune into the kinkier side of things! I'm looking for something a little more long term here, and I don't mind whether I take the role of ""GM"" or the role of a ""Player"" (If you‚Äôre into making this into a Co-GM thing then by all means!) 

So send me how you'd like to approach this! Let me know right off the bat what your kinks and limits are, my only limits are scat and musk play. Beyond that everything can be considered a kink of mine! Although I will ask that there be at least 1 futa in the RP. 

If you'd like to be a player, send me your choices/build! If you'd like to be a GM for me, let me know some of the things you're into and I'll make choices that we both might enjoy!

Hope to hear from you guys! Sorry if it takes a few for me to respond!",[A4A] The Infamous Dungeons and Deviants,2.0,2.0
sf9qo1,"My whole childhood I was a daddies girl. My dad was the most amazing father throughout most my life until I started becoming an adult and now he is no longer in my life and chooses to have nothing to do with me. After I turned 16 it‚Äôs like he was a different person for no reason whatsoever and now I‚Äôm left feeling Incompetent as an adult with a completely uninvolved father
Edit: I am 23 and haven‚Äôt spoken to him since I was 19 
Edit2: for some more details, around age 16 he started becoming angry all the time and every conversation would turn into him starting a fight with me that would always lead to him saying something along the lines ‚Äúyou‚Äôre just like your f*cking mother!‚Äù (My parents had a bad divorce). He just got angrier and angrier and eventually just detached from me completely. I have tried numerous times to reach out but he gets extremely defensive saying things like ‚Äúoh I know I‚Äôm the worst father on the planet.‚Äù All my attempts to rekindle our relationships lead to the same type of arguments we had when I was 16.
I have done nothing to disappoint him, I have been successful my entire life, I own my own house and business and graduated early. not once has he told me he‚Äôs proud.

s9fq8v,"So last night I tried out some degradation that I've been wanting to try. Checked in with the guy first, checked in about aftercare. Wasn't so much a structured 'scene' but much more casual. I told him how his cock was too small for me, how he didn't get hard enough for me or fuck me right. I told him that I was going to find someone with a bigger cock and make him watch me or make him clean my house while I got fucked. 
In the moment, I felt good. I wanted him to feel bad? Shame? Jealous? I'm not sure what the right word is. 
While riding him, I repeated it. Ironic I think that as I'm actively orgasming I'm telling him that he's not doing a good enough job fucking me. 
Afterwards I felt weird. And maybe part of it was that the sleepover didn't happen, but also it feels like how I used to feel about being a sadist. Guilt that I enjoy hurting someone in this way. Guilt that a part of me wants that large thick porno dick that gets hard without me even touching it, just from kissing me. 
And I've checked in with him today, he's good it was all consensual. Anyone else ever feel guilty?

sbwiob,"I'm currently seeing someone who wants a monogamous relationship and we often talk about our reasons. That made me think. I never went to therapy so I don't have the opinion of an expert. 
What I know about myself is, I love the dopamine kick of a new flirt, that warm feeling when someone shows interest in me. During Covid I started to realize that maybe I just don't want to be alone. I tend to write other men more when my boyfriend is out of town. The worst thought that came to my mind is that I could be bored of my life. Is that a reason to flirt with other men? What I clearly can deny is that I'm seeking something better than my boyfriend. I love him and I think it couldn't get any better. But that could also be my brain, saving me from being alone. What my boyfriend, best friends and even my family always tell me is, that I have nearly zero self esteem. So the open relationship is my backdoor to prove my worth and get validation.

 I also hate how so many of the jobs list what they 'want' but rarely explain why I should want to work for them.

sgc5i8,"Somehow, the cheating wasn‚Äôt what made me the angriest, or the verbal abuse. I caught onto the gaslighting after a while, so it became pretty easy to point out when he was trying to do it.

His silence infuriated me though. He loved to ghost me for days on end. He lived an hour away, so most of our conversations were over text. He would just stop responding to me in the midst of conversation, disappear for the rest of the day (if not longer), then reappear as if nothing happened.

He knew it bothered me when he would do that. In the beginning, I tried to calmly explain to him my needs and boundaries; that I didn‚Äôt need *constant* communication from him, but that the random disappearing for entire evenings or days at a time with no explanation wasn‚Äôt cool. He would always try to say ‚Äúmy phone died‚Äù ‚ÄúI fell asleep‚Äù ‚ÄúI was at work‚Äù for these extended disappearances.

After months of me trying to keep my cool, it started making me angry, as I could tell he didn‚Äôt care and knew that it bothered me. I would get frustrated with him for ghosting, he would gaslight me for being overly emotional, I would leave, he would Hoover, I would think I was being melodramatic and give him another chance, so on and so forth‚Ä¶

I don‚Äôt know what it was about November. After realizing he was a narc, catching him cheating, catching him in countless lies and manipulation tactics, countless arguments, and just overall being unhappy, something just switched. Instead of being so emotionally invested in our arguments, I developed this whole attitude of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm too fucking old for this and I have no time for it‚Äù.

He ghosted me one final time, and this time, I just asked myself ‚Äúwhy the fuck should I bother trying to get a response out of him? After everything he has done to me, I‚Äôm going to BEG him to talk to me?‚Äù and blocked on everything.

He was so mad and offended, he reached out to me via email that he knew I had blocked him. We had one final, brief argument over email, in which I told him to just leave me alone, and I finally stopped responding for good. I decided I had said everything I needed to, and I was done.

From that point forward, the silence that he used as a means of hurting me has now become a very peaceful, calm absence of chaotic energy in my life. I‚Äôm not constantly pulling teeth to try to make things work with someone who was horrible to me. I‚Äôm not constantly trying to explain myself and how this person‚Äôs actions harmed me, when they ultimately did not care.

He still tries to email me from time to time. The emails show up in my spam folder, because the website I use doesn‚Äôt have a system in place to prevent him from attempting to reach me. He will beg for me to forgive him and take him back, say how much he loves me and how sorry he is for how he treated me, all the things he knew I would‚Äôve wanted to have heard back then, but it means nothing to me. I just delete it and continue my day, just as I would if it were a spam email.

He doesn‚Äôt have my phone number, and he‚Äôs blocked on all social media. He never made any effort to get to know my friends or family, so there is nobody to check up on me on his behalf. He lives in another town an hour away, doesn‚Äôt know my new address, and doesn‚Äôt have a car to try to find me. So, I‚Äôm essentially unreachable to him. I‚Äôm gone, away, and I feel safe and peaceful.

He used silence as a weapon; he knew it harmed me when he would ghost me and would get an emotional response out of me, so he would do it to stay in control and keep me on my toes at all times. The silence that has come from him being gone has been the best form of healing, and helped me see the upsides of being alone.

s94pc2,"I am 28, a male, and on tons of psychiatric medications and on fentanyl and meth now, because I can't handle life. My life has been absolutely horrifying, from the abuse as a kid up into the failures as an adult. I always thought I'd be very successful as an adult, because I was good-looking, muscular, tall, hopeful, intelligent, and had a good work ethic, but BS legal charges totally destroyed my life. Even though I am no criminal, and no one would ever really mistake me for someone that is, I have had my life destroyed by the legal system. And she was the last good thing in my life. I've never had anyone get to know me like she did, and she truly loved me, and she said she would never turn on me and that I could trust her. Well she did turn on me, just like everyone else did, and this is it. I can't take this pain anymore, I just don't want to live. My life sucks, and I know I won't ever find anyone that will love me like she did. I need her back, I need her so badly, I need her more than air. Idk what to do, we were together all the time, never apart, unless we were at work, for almost 2 years straight, really about a year and 9 months. I can't handle this, this is too much. My life was already bad, but she turned on me. I can't do this man, idk why god does this to me. This emotional pain hurts so much. it has nothing to do with looks either, but everything to do with just how great she was. 

She was religious, she didn't believe in the feminist man-hating BS that most women do nowadays, she actually wanted the same stuff I did, to live on a farm in a small town and raise our family and have a bunch of animals and we were gonna love each other and be around just our family and forget about everybody else. I need her back. I can't do this rn, this hurts so much. She cut off contact with me and I honestly just wanna be with her and only her. I loved her with all my heart and soul, you can't possibly love a human being more than I loved her, I can't believe she just forgot about me. Everyone turns their back on me, I hate everybody. I just wish I would die rn.

What do I even do? My life is destroyed rn, and I keep running in circles in life, and I'm constantly getting nowhere, I have no real friends, I'm trying to get our of the death grip of the legal system finally. I started getting into trouble at 21, at first getting a felony DUI that ruined my college football career. It was because I barely tapped a lady with my car who was walking across the street at a green light, and I even braked not to hit her. But it's obvious what she was doing, she was a personal injury attorneys wife and was just doing it for a cash grab, and she sued my insurance company for 90k ultimately, and gave me my first felony, a DUI. Second charge ever, my first was reckless driving. I was 21 when it happened, and I've gotten charge after charge after that, all for stupid small things that only were made into big deals because I already had a felony. Now I'm 28 and finally (maybe) about to complete probation in another year and get off probation probably at 29, and I can't get a good job because I have felonies, no education, no training of any kind, not even a driver's license right now. 

And my other big problem in life is that I have low testosterone because I used to take steroids in college to compete in football. Everybody was doing it, so I did it too, to compete and do as well as them. But one of my final cycles, I took deca and that's what made my gonads shrink and my testosterone has never been the same. I even tried to get on hcg and stuff like that for a bit, which is a hormone that's supposed to repair natural testosterone levels, but it didn't work probably wasn't on it long enough though. But I have been on and off testosterone replacement therapy for like 5 years now. Actually, I usually just get testosterone and just take clinical doses of it.i order it online or get it from an anabolic steroids dealer in person. But my ex wife decided she didn't wanna keep doing this about a year and a half ago, so she told me to go get it through a doctor. So I'm trying to get it through a doctor, and they did blood work, and it showed my testosterone was low, in the low 200s, and my prolactin was 3 times as high as it should be, which can be fixed with an estrogen blocker. Which I also can't find. And so they prescribed the testosterone, but the insurance company won't even FILL it. Because I have shitty state-funded Medicaid insurance, and they want it to go through a specialist first. But my clinic won't refer me to a specialst, cuz they don't care enough about me to do that. And so, I can't even get erections, I have no sex drive or libido, I have no interest in sex, no interest in girls really, and I'm always tired and have confidence and no energy and I lost a bunch of muscle and gained a bunch of fat, and I'm nowhere near the strength I used to be. But I used to be a stud that every girl fawned over. And now I'm just some ugly drug addict it seems like.

I can't even really workout, because I am so weak and it would be no use really. And I don't have any clothes for it anymore, as some of my clothes were lost, and most were sent up to Oregon with my mom, because I'm moving around so much, and my mom expects me to come up to Oregon to live with her after my probation officer says I'm good to go. But I don't think I'll do that, because my dad is gonna help pay for an apartment down here in Arizona, and I would rather not live with my crazy mom. I have tried it before and it has never worked out

But I need to get my ex-wife back, because this shit is killing me. I don't want any other girl besides her either, I just want her. It took me time to fall in love with her, and I can't believe she can just forget about me like that. I loved her so much, I can't explain how much I loved her. More than human being could love each other really. I felt like we were one mind half the time. She was usually correcting me on stuff too. She was just so much better than any other woman I've been around. I need her back, I love her so much. I would do anything to get her back","(28m) I loved my ex-wife as much as you could possibly love a human being, and now she's gone and I can't get her back.

s1e0kk,"For some, this is purely fantasy. For some, this is an occasional escape. For some this is a lifestyle. It doesn‚Äôt matter I guess, what brings any of us here, male or female. It‚Äôs something we find value in.

For me, and I suspect to varying degrees for many women, there is a safety in this. It provides emotional support, and self worth (of a sort) and value, when we are reduced to an it. To nothing. Warm holes to choke, fuck, use, and even abuse. To slap, pinch, shove, and even hit.

Maybe some of us here have stressful lives, and this allows a shedding of all responsibility. Here, it doesn‚Äôt matter.¬† If we are nothing, we are responsible for nothing.

Maybe some of us have had rough or bad upbringings. Past abuse, pain, and a fucked up history that makes up wake up screaming at night. Here, that doesn‚Äôt matter. It can be a plus. We are nothing and you can‚Äôt hurt nothing.

Maybe some of us are lost, despondent, over what we should do in life. We are aimless, shiftless, a future that has no beginning or end. Here, it doesn‚Äôt matter. We are nothing, but we are given purpose, use, a reason. We are nothing and we are wanted.

Most likely, we fall in a mix of these. I know I do.

It‚Äôs an escape, or was, at one time. From myself, from responsibility, from stress. I was just a trashy cunt for an older man to use and that made me feel value. At 13, the men online degrading me cared (no matter what they said ‚Äì they were investing time in me) more, in a way, about me than my mother did. Maybe they wanted to mold me just as she did, maybe they were grooming me, and maybe they succeeded. It doesn‚Äôt matter though because, unlike after dealing with my mom, after they were done with me, I felt better. I had done a good job and was often praised for it. Nothing can‚Äôt go lower.

Jack taught me I could be nothing but trash and valued. A strange dichotomy that exists to this day, even intensified. And I‚Äôll be honest, being valued for being nothing makes me want to be nothing for him. I want to take his stress onto me, because it makes him happy. I want his seed in me, because it makes him happy. I want his tattoos and piercings, because it makes him happy. I want his marks and bruises and hurts all on me, because it makes him happy.

I can be his little girl, a chain smoking teenage trailer trash, a drunk slut, a coke whore, an oral skank sucking off men at an adult theater or bar. I can be a toy to share with friends, a dog fucker, a thing called cunt, a needy animal craving abuse. I can be all those things, for him and myself.

He can choke me and I‚Äôll smile. He can slap me and I‚Äôll smile. He can punch me to the ground and I‚Äôll cry and I‚Äôll smile. I can be strapped and mashed and thrown around. Because he wants it, because I get off on it, and in that convergence, he smiles. And I‚Äôll smile even bigger even if I scream doing so.

And in making him happy, I gain the value and self worth I need to be happy. I can be a fistable punch bag whore and still be valued, wanted, and even loved. And I‚Äôm happy to do that, I want to do that, I get drunk on being that for him. Maybe it‚Äôs grooming, maybe it‚Äôs love, and maybe it‚Äôs my nature. None of that matters.

I get safety, value, from being an it. I still have marker on my chest from yesterday where his friend Tony wrote on me, I still have bruises where Jack hit me, my eye is still yellowed from where he made me pretty.

A few people have confessed to her they have feelings and obviously she seems pretty pleased by that. She seems to attract attention by just....being, whereas I have to be active and proactive in many aspects to have attention as a man by women.

I've talked about this with my therapist and he basically said  I'm envious about her and her ease in obtaining attention and that's something I should make peace with.

So, I'm asking this subreddit, anyone else feel the same? Are you jealous women seem to get much more attention easily?

She's keen to point out she's never been a slut... but we'll all make up our own minds about that.

And the cherry on the cake... she only ever used condoms with her first, and even then not always. Out of all 20+ people, only two people never came inside her. She says she's never had a one night stand, but I know she was not exclusive with some people at uni while she was trying to decide who she wanted to go out with (try before you buy scenario I think) and there was definitely less than 24 hours between people at times.

sf8jf7,"My (early 20s F) dad (late 50s M) has always been, IMO, uncomfortably interested in my life, and I don't mean as a normal dad...or at least I don't think so. He would always read my diaries when I was younger, and then cry and ask why I hated him when I asked him to stop (and then I'd catch him doing it again, so I stopped writing in them). From around age \~10, he would routinely, at least weekly, go through my bra and underwear drawer and make comments about what I had, which he continues to do with the remaining few I have at their house. When I was around 16/17 and bought thongs (literally *solely* for the purpose of not having panty lines show through tighter pants) he threw a shitfit to my mom and accused of being a slut. When I was 18 I moved to a dorm for college (3 hours away from my parents) and we went to a concert together; I was wearing a knee-length shift dress. He got on the floor, looked up my dress, and then yelled at me that it was too short, and when I told my mom about it, denied it and furiously called me a liar. Now that I have a boyfriend and am taking birth control, he is obsessive about my birth control pills, despite me being 3 hours away. When I was home for the holidays, he checked my pills everyday (which he does *every time* I'm back) and looked through my trash (which he often does for various things) when I threw it out during the placebo week (because you don't need to take the sugar pills during the placebo week...) and threw a massive shitfit until I had to explain birth control to my boomer father, who has a degree in science. Today, we were on the phone until he accused me of being pregnant out of the blue, for literally NO REASON WHATSOEVER. I am currently on my period, with a menstrual cup jammed up my vagina, and have never been pregnant in my entire life. As calmly as I could, I told him that I was not pregnant and asked him why he felt he needed to ask me that; he proceeded to swiftly move onto some other topic and not address what I asked.

I guess I just wanted to rant, but I would appreciate any advice if you have some to share. I really, genuinely, cannot tell him to fuck off because he is paying for my education and housing and keeps me extremely financially dependent on him and I'm not allowed to get a job. I am *extremely* grateful for the help, and I am extremely fortunate and privileged to come from a middle class/maybe upper middle class household with two married parents, but this shit he does is a small portion of the things he does that makes me see red. I have a strong relationship with my mother, and don't ever foresee not talking to him because of that, and additionally being an only child, but I guess our relationship might be different soon because he keeps threatening to move to Europe when he retires next year. I know other people's experiences with BPD parents are so much worse, but every time when I see him it's demanding to know about my birth control, fat-shaming me over the phone (I am slightly overweight), implying that I'm lazy and stupid, accusing me of being a hoarder (my apartment is pretty damn clean and very much not a hoard), and accusing me of not being cut out for my career path that he is also at the same time supportive of me going into? I just wish there was a magic word I could tell to him that would make him stop pulling his shit.

sdhgmr,"This is a bit of a rant, so I'm sorry.

I've talked to a lot of different people today. Many of them telling me how I should be or explaining what a ""real daddy"" is. I promise you the almost every Sissy you meet here has talked to more ""daddies"" than you have. We know what a daddy is better than you do. We know what most of them want better than you do. If you have personal preference that's great! But don't think you are special or you have an idea of what is right and wrong.

If you want to be a good Daddy, COMMUNICATE! Ask what your sissy wants and what they need. They will probably be on all fours for you in a second! Just show some respect, get consent, and treat them how they want to be treated. Maybe that's as a queen and maybe it's a dumpster, but stop assuming you know which before asking. 

And also ""daddies"" I've probably talked to more sissies than you have too. I know there is a minority who will disagree a d you will want to tell me about them.

rxnmmd,"First playthrough, really taken aback by the story so far. (just got to the Forest)

Here's a few things I've picked up on already, but please enlighten me to anything else that's a must do / must not do.

1. Dodge has a very small window, but almost mastered it. Can do some pretty rough fights without taking damage.

2. Combos on weapons (I've spear main and heavy sword secondary) kick ass, but noticed you can't always pull them off as a perfect dodge seems to reset the combo. Sucks when you've a Lt 6 Hv 2 combo you can barely get off.

3. Started the game on normal mode. It seems a bit too easy (I've platinumed every soulsbourne game so dodging/deflecting/and aggressive combat isn't a big deal to me.) Shall I play through normal first, or just swap to hard now? (Can it be changed mid play through?)

4. Some quests are a bit ""go here, go back to there, go back to here, go back there"" tooing and froing. Does this get easier? I know the transporters help, but still...

5. Love the chip system. Reminds me of materia from FF7. I've basically stacked 50% heal on kill, 10% heal on damage, and then filled the rest full of attack chips. If I die.... I lose these for good if I don't get to my body in time right? I've only died once, but was right next to my spawn point so reclaimed it no problem.

6. There have been a few times where the camera pans out to like a platform game during combat. This has sometimes made me mistake 2B for 9S so I'm getting confused why I'm taking damage when not being hit lol. Although I kinda weirdly like this addition, is there a way to turn it off to make it all third person view?

That's all from me for now folks, any ideas I'm welcomed to hear! Really looking forward to getting stuck further into this game.",First playthrough / Die hard FF1-15 / Any tips on what to do / not do?,2.0,2.0

rtmgqp,"I cannot express how much I hate this couple. It was really cringy and out of the blue. Aaron Tevit the actor of Tripp is really hot but I hate Tripp. Serena constantly tries to resist him and tells him that they cannot work together but Tripp keeps pushing it and flirts with her. In my opinion, Tripp manipulates Serena into leaving her family for him and promises her on divorcing Maureen when it is more complicated than that. After Serena finds out that he‚Äôs been lying to her he tries to win her back in a desperate attempt by telling he loves her. If he really loved her he wouldn‚Äôt have left her alone at the accident site and moved her to the driver‚Äôs seat in order to frame her. I know that Maureen tells him to do that but he did it under his own jurisdiction. Then when Nate confronts him about the accident and frames Serena his excuse was ‚ÄúI called 911‚Äù it was definitely satisfying when Nate punched him. He was never completely honest with her and was a piece of shit. Serena wasn‚Äôt a saint either in this dynamic but then again there is a big power imbalance. I‚Äôm so mad that Tripp didn‚Äôt get as much hate as he deserves. Unrelated, but Maureen was lowkey a girl boss and such an interesting character.",Let's revisit Serena and Tripp,2.0,2.0

If something is good, it will get there organically. Jumping up and down and screaming to be put there isn't a good look. Just chill.

s0e9vg,"First there was nothing, which was also the two faced god named Ah and Ah, and one face was of change and one was of unchange, their dual mind was time, infinite instances of stasis coagulated into the temporal cone of progression, though some say it a sphere. 

And Ah who was also called Lithim, said unto nothing the words that have no form and hold meaning found only in reflection, and nothing, who was also called Ah bled, for his nature formed a contradiction. And the naked blood of nothing became area, or space, a place where things can be and can not be. This is the lamentation of the lovers, though some say it a vow.

From the blood came one, for hierarchy and difference did not exist in this time and nothing would not speak it, and he she was the mother father Whinn, who would be called the sire of unfather, though some say he is the sword. 

The sphere the vow and the sword, testament to unknowledge and truth, which bring the dukes of eye and tongue to dance the song of touch. This is called the poem of truth though it would tell you lies. 

This is called the path of paths and its touch is cold and hot. 
And so the world was shattered from their war, for Yav was eldest though both were born at once, yen and Yav, and one was split asunder, but nothing was was not him, declared war on himself and nothing, yenYav who was first of the sight. 
This is called the path of paths and is written as it was. 

His names forgotten and his war destroyed, that one looked upon nothing for a time and nothing unsaw him, thus creating difference. 
And from here the barons of movement and soul and pain and night came from his wounds of non existence, and with them nothing was gone for there was nowhere it could be. 

This is the end of the first and it was written by me, though some say not. 

‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢

The hanged god whose name has no shape, he speaks into presence his son, who is half and half, born out of time, from nothing. And his son says to him the words whose meaning is of pain, for half and half is also called the three eyed jester, and his shape is blue and gold and red, and his form is Almalekh and his name is a wingless raven. The tortured god takes out his pins and pulls back the temporal curtain, so that half and half is one in nothing. And he speaks the words of heresy in the aperture of the golden one, Sharath, who was duke of the song one hears when forgotten in lust. And Sharath, the golden one, loses his song and skin, and from his song-skin the father who is without head sews his son half and half with the corpse of a termite, or an Alden, who are called the elves. 

This is the song of Sharath, who was duke of the difference between the two threes of thirty three: 

Golden king on sightfull hill, 

golden crown above the dunes, 

ungot of woes and misery is gone now, 
and his hill of truth is now nonsense. 

‚Ä¢‚Ä¢

The father of hickory and harvest begot the children of sun and idiom, the half and half is the harp played by nothing in nowhere where he went, the dune of war and wrath and wonder lives in oneself, look and one would see it. This is not false or true but domain of the duke who rules in between. 

This is the song of mystery and luck, who are brother sister to one another: 
One of twelve and twelve in one.
Two of fifteen and fifteen in two. 
Not of one and two of ten in two.  
The rest is none and nothing is none, for no one said nothing is not. 
One is seven as one is one, for seven is false. 
Three is five as three and three is three tens and three, which is to say it false. 
The end is over and over is ended. 
this was sung by me, though some say not. 

Nothing lives in nowhere, these are the words of no one.

‚Ä¢‚Ä¢

‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢

Nephel: the aspect of pain has come to receive the judgment of the law, one before many, in sight of all. I beseech my peers to judge harshly and fairly. 

Nephel: great unfather, you stand accused of murdering the noble one and an Alden called Sonnas, the accuser is the baron whose dominion is truth and falsehood. 

Pain: the accuser, whose name is black moon, and is king of that, speaks truly. 

Nephel: great one, the justice for murder is one hundred lashes and the pike, do you accept the wisdom of the judges? 

Pain: I do. 

And so pain was whipped and brought low and a new name was formed of his plight, its shape was the tortured god. And so it was. 

‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢

Pain rides with his chosen one whose name is Yennair. He is in search of the fire. She, who is his chosen, knows the way to that place. And as they approach it she grows apprehensive. So pain pushes her into it. And she has doubts no longer as it is in the center of her eye no longer. Her duke of pale thought witnessed this. This is the word of the first flame, though some say it a rapture.

rvyqw2,,I had a great job. The rich girl‚Äôs parents basically paid me to be their daughters friend hoping I‚Äôd be a good influence. They asked me to stay the night and I obliged not knowing they were fed up and wanted to swap the two of us. I was woken up by a loud male scream‚Ä¶ was it from my old body?! (RP),,
rve8r8,,"I hung around after school too long, and the bullies showed up~",,
s9v754,"In my final year of highschool i met this guy who just left his old school to come to mine. For some reason we clicked and became really good friends. What i admired about him most was how extremely kind and sweet he was. He didn‚Äôt seem to have a single bad bone in his body. 

One day while we were on the train he randomly brought up that he‚Äôs always wanted to try acid and wanted to do it with a friend so i agreed. i had never tried it beforehand or anything similar. he said we should do it as his house and that he‚Äôs parents weren‚Äôt going to be home.

when i arrived there we went to his room and we took the two tabs. i arrived quite early as acid can last up to 12-15 hours. it was fun at first, we watched rick and morty, laughed at the walls moving and closing in. probably was just staring at each other for hours without realising. it was a cool experience. and in a blink the sun already went down and it was pitch black outside. 

the whole time i could barely move. i laid down for most of the trip and my limbs were basically paralysed most i could do was barely sit up let alone walk. we were on his bed the whole time and at this point it was around 9:00 pm. 

we were listening to music and i caught him just staring at me and then he suddenly leaned in and started making out with me. this wasn‚Äôt bad as i thought it was harmless and funny until he roughly tore my clothes off and starting having s*x with me. he was on top of me and one point started choking me, pushing his whole body weight on me. my body was slightly mobile but still extremely weak. i can‚Äôt even remember what my mind was thinking because to be honest it didn‚Äôt feel real. my body felt completely detached. i was so incredibly confused and scared.

i had to tell him to get the f*ck off me and i shoved him off. i left his house and was picked up. 

the following weeks he manipulated me into thinking i wanted it. and for i while i thought i did. i had a gut feeling it wasn‚Äôt right but i didn‚Äôt want to be a victim so i made myself think it was okay. we continued sleeping together in secret until one of my classmates who was a friend at the time found out after she saw hickies on both of our necks and she told me that he had r*ped her at her house a couple weeks before i was at his house. i felt sick to my stomach because all the denial i had was true. all of my fears were confirmed and it felt like a nightmare i couldn‚Äôt wake up from. from the start thought he was such a nice guy, i felt betrayed, confused and violated.

i confronted him about it and he denied it and then fled the school and never returned. throughout the whole thing he stuck to his narrative that he didn't do anything and tried to contact me when my friend reported it and was going through the case with the police, I cut all contact from him and stuck by my friend's side.unfortunately due to lack of evidence me and my friend have had a hard time. and I still am not ready to take this step.she reassured me and told me she was proud of me for even wanting to talk about it and I promised her I'd do anything for her to help. She has decided to dismiss it as the evidence wasn't enough and she knew I was still trying to heal. it's a shitty situation for the both of us.

what makes me unable to sleep at night is the fact that when i look back, he planned out the whole thing. he purposely made sure no one was there to help me, got me high and vulnerable and when his body wasn‚Äôt limp he made his move. he knew how it would all play out. and i always wonder why he left his old school. did he do this to someone else?",i was raped by my friend when we took acid.,2.0,2.0

1' | The match has just started.

I have red hair, so the transition from one ginger to another should make the move easy.

Some things you might like to know about me before you consider supporting me.

* I can't do a cartwheel but I can do a handstand against a wall which is pretty good for a 32 year old, not gonna lie.
* I dropped out of school but became an accountant later in life so if I set my mind to something I can get it done, and right now I'd like to be the Duke of Suxxex, so you're in safe hands.
* I would have a bi-annual sandwhich luncheon. My girlfriend told me I should make it a high tea but I told her that I wanted the luncheon to be accessable to everyone and currently I can't stir my tea without hitting the sides of the teacup so I don't think a high tea would leave me looking capable to people that come. When I say bi-annual I mean every two years rather than twice a year because I don't know the costs associated with a open entry sandwhich luncheon so baby steps I guess, I'm also not sure if the Duke gets a salary, but these are things we can discuss down the road.
* I call it football, not soccer.
* I think Piers Morgan is a penis, I don't know how you feel about him but I just wanted that out in the open
* I've been double vaxxed and have my booster tomorrow, so odds are we can cuddle and you won't get sick
* I would have a strong stance against any vikings that raid and not give into their demands, give them gold, silver or provide them any horses to raid Northumbria.
* Canada is very nice but I promise I won't move there.

If you think I'm a good fit for the position, please email or text the queen and just let her know that she doesn't need to put the job out to tender as I can head over whenever and get started. I need to give my current employer 2 weeks notice though but other than that we can kick this off right away.

Edit: I forgot to add that I ride a Triumph

Edit 2: At least 3 people and my mum said I could probably do the job so we only need a few more to get the Queens attention.

Edit 3: its almost 3am and I normally would be asleep by now but given the positive response I will be quitting my job on Monday, so I'm going to try to adjust to UK time early for the inevitable move.","Dear CasualUK, I would like to be the Duke of Suxxex but need your help.",2.0,2.0

s2o0pk,"I‚Äôve been having a terrible week because humiliation and shame have been eating away at my mind. I feel so betrayed and disgusting thinking about some things, and even more hurt at the fact that my older sister (who I am extremely close to) did nothing. Ever since I moved in with my dad at 8 he used me as an emotional crutch. Venting to me telling me that I‚Äôm ‚Äúthe only person he can talk to about this stuff‚Äù motherfucker you have grown ass friends. He physically abused me for a long time when I was an innocent little child. I was so tiny and fragile and he would throw me around and hurt me for absolutely no reason. I remember him punching me because I didn‚Äôt like a gas station bbq sandwich. I remember building up the courage to tell my mom and show her the knot and bruise on my head. You know what she did? Sent him a snarky little text. No help. No love. No care. She used him abusing me as a way to get back at him or ‚Äúown‚Äù him. I was in elementary, all I wanted was help. I remember being so excited for my grammy to come over because that meant he couldn‚Äôt hurt me as much. I would beat and cut myself in elementary because of the way he treated me. I would sit in my closet and strangle myself with a belt til I couldn‚Äôt see. I planned out my suicide. 

Then one day he stopped hurting me. I was free to have a good relationship with my father without the abuse finally. Until he started sexualizing me. Telling me how all girls are jealous of my curves. Telling me how he likes his women curvy like me. Saying my body was more appealing to him than my sisters because I was shaped nicely. ‚ÄúBody hair on women is such a turn off, go shave now!‚Äù I remember him screaming at me for an hour because my jeans weren‚Äôt skin tight. I was going to hang out with friends and felt nice in my outfit. I was excited but he ruined it. Screaming at me that I shouldn‚Äôt hide my body, that men like curvy women and my curves were attractive. The jeans weren‚Äôt baggy at all, they just weren‚Äôt skinny jeans. He wouldn‚Äôt let me leave until I put on my skinny jeans and I went in my friends car bawling. It was humiliating, and to top it off he called me while I was hanging out to berate me some more and when I got back he was still pissed. I was 13-14.

I will never forget when he would touch my ass. I begged and cried for him to stop but he yelled at me like I was the one being bad. ‚ÄúIm your dad I can do whatever I want to you!‚Äù After a few times of arguing and ending in tears I gave up trying. Worst part was that my older sister did nothing. She watched and laughed like it was a joke. HAHA EVERYONE LOOK AT HOW HE GRABS AND SLAPS AND PINCHES MY ASS AFTER I BEGGED HIM TO STOP ITS SO FUCKING FUNNY ISN‚ÄôT IT? She fucking joined in. Even my fucking little brother started spanking me. I lost it and cried to my sister. She had kept spanking me and I asked nicely multiple times for her to stop but she kept doing it. I begged and yelled and cried to her hoping she‚Äôd understand how uncomfortable it made me but no. She kept reaching to touch it while I was crying to her. I threw the silverware I was holding on the floor and she gave me a disgusted look as if I was the one who did wrong. It‚Äôs always my fucking fault isn‚Äôt it? Am I such a sick fuck for wanting them to not touch me like that? Is it my fault that I was hit and thrown around? Am I such a worthless fuck that no one ever bothered to help me? Sick fucker used me for his emotions. Fucker grabbed me and threw me to the ground as an innocent little child, and then grabbed my ass and tell me how if he was my age I‚Äôd be the type of girl he wanted. My father loved me dearly I cannot deny. He treated me very well growing up and treats me well now and I am forever in his debt. I was his favorite child, he told me himself. Daddy‚Äôs girl. Always. But I‚Äôm extremely bitter. I struggle with anorexia because of my dads attraction to my curves. I cant eat normally anymore again because I feel sick and scared about what he sees when he looks at me. He told me that really thin women were a turn off to him. I want to be a turn off to him. I don‚Äôt ever want to hear about how desirable I am to him ever again. Is it my fault that our relationship twisted into something gross? Is it my fault he sexualized me? Of course it fucking is. Because it‚Äôs always my fault.",Anger over covert incest and no one ever helping me,1.0,2.0

But He told others about it and I got that reputation because the others knew he was a racist treating me badly and I orgasmed from it ..

And that‚Äôs when a lot of men would lie to me act in love and all until we are in bed and I see their real racist self ‚Ä¶ but i never could hold myself from  cumming from it ‚Ä¶ idk what‚Äôs wrong with me being‚Ä¶ orgasm from being treated like literally a piece of shit and by a man being racist to me , and I just feed his ego and pride by orgasming from it like I prove that he‚Äôs right‚Ä¶
Which they aren‚Äôt, it‚Äôs wrong what they do and their ideology is so wrong ! Racism is wrong .

But idk whenever the guy is racist like that I end up orgasming so hard.. 

Like some guys would try and just roleplay it and act that way but I don‚Äôt enjoy it at all‚Ä¶ like I just know it‚Äôs fake so it‚Äôs a turn off to me‚Ä¶

Anyway now those racists don‚Äôt really respect me after how hard I orgasm when I‚Äôm with them‚Ä¶ and  like I‚Äôm always invited to those frat parties that are filled by racist men and women that just see me as something to laugh at or play with or use‚Ä¶ 

And after everytime I hate myself and feel so bad because it‚Äôs wrong and I‚Äôm just feeding their racism  but idk humans are weak against their desires ‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs not what I want but idk why my body is like this and why do they have to be that hot but racist


( to clarify, I‚Äôm not saying that whites are racist, no . They aren‚Äôt at all, I‚Äôm just study in an area that has a huge racist influence. And yes they are wrong and I regret what I did with them or just letting them have me cause since they had me once idk but they had an affect on my body which I‚Äôm guessing because the whole thing is just taboo and wrong‚Ä¶ and that explains why I don‚Äôt feel the same with someone who is just roleplaying. )",[f] As an Arab girl‚Ä¶ I hate how my body reacts to racist hateful white men,2.0,0.0

The problem is that whenever we try to do penetration, which is something I really want to try, I experience an intense sharp pain we have to stop immediately although I‚Äôm very wet and turned on after a lot of foreplay.  I have a considerable pain tolerance, but this type of pain is just too much it makes me cry. The furthest we could ever go was him inserting his index finger. Anything more than that in girth can‚Äôt get in and starts pushing on my urethra. It‚Äôs like the entrance is too small to accommodate a penis, not even the tip. This makes me frustrated with myself and makes me wonder if there‚Äôs something wrong with me. 
I‚Äôm considering seeing a gynaecologist , but since I‚Äôm from a country where sex outside marriage can even land you in jail, I‚Äôm not sure I can honestly speak to them about this issue. 
Has anyone here experienced a similar issue in the first time they did penetration? If yes, I‚Äôd really like to get some tips and advice from you because I‚Äôm really getting frustrated with myself.

She also acknowledged that what she does is wrong and said she is working on it, hasn‚Äôt been with anyone in awhile, and she ‚Äúhas issues no one understands‚Äù. She said that more than anything, she‚Äôs hurt because I really thought she‚Äôd sleep with my husband despite not trying to do so in the over 15 years we‚Äôve all known each other. I brought up things she‚Äôs done in the past that has added to my discomfort and she insisted that it was innocent and she never meant anything by it. She said she‚Äôs going to leave permanently because she doesn‚Äôt feel welcome knowing she isn‚Äôt trusted and she doesn‚Äôt want to stay where she‚Äôs not wanted. She went silent for what seemed like forever, then said, ‚ÄúI think you did the right thing. If the situation was reversed, I would ask you to leave, too‚Äù, then says again that she has issues and she‚Äôs not sure why she does it. She started to cry and I told her that whatever she‚Äôs going through can be worked on and she can talk to someone who can help her sort out her feelings and give her some insight and she said she would work on herself. We hugged it out and I told her I‚Äôll be here for her while she works through it all.**

(36f) live with my husband and child. My best friend, Stacie (37f) has been staying with us the last few weeks while her home undergoes renovation. 

I met my best friend in college and we are pretty opposite when it comes to a lot of things. She‚Äôs far more carefree, particularly with men. She loves dating committed men. Wives, fianc√©s, or girlfriend, she doesn‚Äôt care and will pursue ‚Äúfor the thrill‚Äù. There have been a couple occasions where she‚Äôs been confronted publicly by spouses and she just laughs it off after the fact. 

Although she can be a bit flirtatious, she‚Äôs never actually done anything totally out of line with my husband, but she has with the boyfriend of a mutual friend. Now the issue! I am going to Las Vegas  in a couple days and I‚Äôll be gone for 5 days. I told her that I would prefer if she stayed elsewhere while I am gone.  She asked why and I told her it is because of her history of going after men in relationships and I wasn‚Äôt comfortable with her there while I‚Äôm gone for so long. 

She got really defensive, hurt and started to cry. She insisted that she values our friendship and would never violate that, but I held firm and said that this is just one of those things where I‚Äôd rather be safe than sorry. She‚Äôll be staying at another friend‚Äôs house. I feel bad, but I also don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm going to change my mind. My husband doesn‚Äôt care either way and said she should understand why I feel that way, but my sister and a couple of our mutual friends said that I should trust her, and even if I don‚Äôt, I should trust my husband.

rupfu2,"Dianne Wiest‚Äôs character‚ÄîMike McClusky‚Äôs mother, Miriam McClusky‚Äîis a smug, self-righteous Leftist who thinks she is more wise than everyone else. I cannot stand her constant condescending attitude and self-styled mores that only lead to her own smug assertion of self-righteousness. She seems to think that just because she was married to the father of her boys for so many years that she knows what is going on and knows what it takes to change the system. (That is like Hillary Clinton thinking that she gained political ‚Äúexperience‚Äù by being the wife of the duly elected Governor of Arkansas during his eight years in office or the by being the wife of the duly elected President of the United States of America during his eight years in office. Well‚Äîshe didn‚Äôt. It doesn‚Äôt work that way.) Mrs. McClusky isn‚Äôt in the trenches like her sons, day in and day out. She has no clue what it takes to deal with these animals. Guards at the women‚Äôs prison keep her safe, which is the ONLY reason she is safe from harm in her little Leftist propaganda study hall. Her attitude toward the female inmate, Cherry, who murdered the guard she had sex with, Sam‚ÄîGuard Tim Weaver‚Äôs nephew‚Äîwas reminiscent of that #MeToo bullshit, that we should ‚Äúbelieve women‚Äù. She lied! We KNOW she lied! She is a convicted felon and an inmate. They lie!

I will, however, give Mrs. McClusky credit for one thing: She is not wrong about her advice to her son, Kyle‚Äîthat he should quit everything and move away with his wife and baby son and start over. That is the best advice she could have given him. No one is a victim of their situation. If you‚Äôre not happy with your situation, then change it! You ALWAYS have choices.

s29idw,"So in my early twenties I started to always keep a box of tampons and a pack of contraceptive pills (not the morning after one, the one you take regularly) at home for the occasion that whomever I'm with at the moment might need one of these items, but forgot them or something. I also do that when I'm single. I restock whenever it's almost gone and this practice has ben very useful on many occasion.

My current gf thought it was surprising when we first started dating, but she said in a good way. Now on the other hand this topic came up with some friends yesterday and they thought it's super 'weird af' to do that and they've never heard of a guy buying tampons or pills just in case.

Edit: The BC is the one prescribed to 80% of women where I am and I get the prescription renewed whenever necessary by my gp. He thinks it's ok to have a pack at home for safety reasons when you're sexualy active.

Edit 2: I am in Austria, getting BC is not an issue if you're older than 12 and sexualy active - even as a man. My insurance covers it too. According to this comment by a professional I'm not the only one:

scrafd,"Title says it all, I've been in since last year pre 8.01 days. I haven't really given it any thought because until very recently the idea of the *event* kicking off just didn't seem real. Sure we had the fun run-up to 70's but most knew that wasn't really anything compared to what's actually been cooking.

Now however we are seeing historic market movements/SEC possibly forcing transparency onto a lot of people who are screaming against it (fingers crossed tomorrow)/AMC & GME taking nose dives like we have been waiting for/SEC talking about possible halting spicy stocks I mean you name it weird shit is kicking off left and right every single day lately. So just me personally but I feel like it is finally time to figure my shit out so that on the day I won't be shitting myself (as much).

Edit: I'm going to get downvoted into oblivion for this but fuck it it's worth saying. 500K probably won't happen, that's just my take and I'm only one dude I could be wrong I'm not psychic but I do know that 513M float times hundreds of millions of fake shares is a lot. Times that lot by 500K, 100K, hell even 25K and it's more money than the country even has. It's just worth thinking about, again I could be wrong fuck me if you do manage to score the high number that's great I'm just wondering if 5-10M retail investors can also hit that crazy number.

My personal exist strategy is simple after 1K see what happens with the gov. If they let it run further then awesome if not it's still a hell of a payday. That's not the whole plan but a good chunk of it.

Edit 2: I‚Äôm not a shill and nobody is paying me, I wish my opinions were worth money lol. I‚Äôm just offering a counter point.

My vision blurry with sleep, I can barely read the dull, red, digital readout of my bedside clock. 3:23 A.M. My girlfriend‚Äôs breath is warm on the back of my neck, her arm draped limply over my side.

‚ÄúDaddy?‚Äù Sarah‚Äôs voice is tiny and nearly inaudible. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs a whore, Daddy?‚Äù my five-year-old daughter insistently asks. I can make out her silhouette in front of my bedroom door.¬†

‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs a--‚Äù she begins, but louder this time.

‚ÄúQuiet!‚Äù I whisper forcefully, cutting her off as I swing my legs over the side of the bed, trying desperately not to wake Amber. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go back to bed, Sarah.‚Äù

I gently guide my daughter out of my bedroom and into the moonlit hallway. Glancing up at the pitch-black entrance to her room; I have a sudden, uneasy feeling that something within its shadows is watching us...

‚ÄúBut what‚Äôs it mean?‚Äù Sarah pushes.

‚ÄúWhy do you ask, sweetie?‚Äù I inquire, as we carefully climb the stairs toward her bedroom.¬†

Sarah‚Äôs mother, Jessica, hadn‚Äôt parted with me on good terms. It had been a horrible fight, mostly about my infidelity. Only an hour later, Jessica was rendered into something barely recognizable as human, after her car plunged off an icy overpass. It‚Äôs for this reason that Sarah‚Äôs next words stop me dead in my tracks.

¬†‚ÄúBecause you need to get that *whore* out of your bed, Daddy.‚Äù

My throat suddenly dry and parched, I slowly turn to face my daughter in her doorway. ‚ÄúExcuse me?‚Äù

My late wife had screamed something nearly identical at me, just moments before she stormed out of our house on that fateful night. Sarah had been at her grandmother‚Äôs house...

‚ÄúDaddy,‚Äù Sarah continued, ‚ÄúI *said* you *need* to get that...WHORE...out of your--‚Äù

With my palm, I attempt futilely to cover Sarah‚Äôs mouth, as she‚Äôs beginning to get louder with every syllable.¬†

‚Äú--get THAT *WHORE* OUT!‚Äù she screams around my hand, as I shove her backward into her dark--

*--it‚Äôs not empty...oh god there‚Äôs something in there--*

--bedroom, close the door, then hold on to the doorknob for dear life, as something much stronger--and which is certainly not my little daughter--tries to reopen it.
¬†¬†¬†
‚ÄúGet her out! OUT! Get. HER.*OUT!*‚Äù A shrieking voice demands from behind the door, but it‚Äôs not Sarah‚Äôs now. It‚Äôs her mother‚Äôs voice; the same, unmistakable one I‚Äôd heard for thirteen miserable years of marriage.¬†

As the seemingly-greased doorknob turns beneath my sweaty palms, the door rattles and thumps arrhythmically in its frame. A blinding white light shines from beneath...

‚ÄúPlease leave us alone! Please go away!‚Äù I beg, tears streaming down my face. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Jessica! I‚Äôm sorry! *Please!*‚Äù¬†

It‚Äôs an eternity later when silence finally returns and the door drifts noiselessly open. Sarah‚Äôs sleeping on the floor; the room is otherwise fine.

ru6h0r,"‚Ä¶ where did this headcanon come from, and why is it so popular?

First off, Boros only melts anything (without a massive energy blast) in the anime, which is an adaptation and not ‚Äúthe main canon‚Äù, so to speak.

Secondly, it‚Äôs not even his speed that melts it. That‚Äôs never stated nor shown anywhere official. It‚Äôs his /energy/ which he cloaks himself in almost all the time. That‚Äôs why Saitama, who‚Äôs going as fast, if not faster in some shots, does not melt it too.

Thirdly, even if it WAS sheer speed melting it, it‚Äôs not THAT impressive a feat considering Boros‚Äô ship has no heat temperature feats besides, again, more headcanon, nor does anyone know how it actually travels through space.

Meteoric Burst is just an upgraded version of all this; not speed melting the ship, but energy. The only time anything melts is when Boros makes contact with something WHILE having his pink aura flared up. And when Saitama goes much faster (like when he blitzed Meteoric Burst Boros), nothing melts in turn.

So all in all, this sounds like a widely shared headcanon used to upgrade Boros‚Äô speed because he doesn‚Äôt really have any real speed feats outside of Meteoric Burst, and yes, this is a pointless rant but I had spare time so I wrote it anyway. Sadly I couldn‚Äôt fit it in less than 20 words.","‚ÄúBoros is so fast, he could melt his own ship with sheer speed!‚Äù",2.0,2.0

ruiqdr,"I know I'm gonna get attacked by the c\*cksuckers for saying this but Idc.

Think about this: most men in relationships are incapable of staying faithful. Most cheat on their gfs and wives even looking the way they do lol.   
Men on average are looking to fuck as many women as possible (they use biology as an excuse for why they can't keep it in their pants  ü§¢ ).  
Most women who date men have had traumas, that's why so many women use the ahstage #menaretrash on twitter and talk abt their experiences and trauma-bond with other women.it's not just women who use the hashtag #menaretrash. Men use it too, for example fathers who claim tehy don't want their daughters dating, because they know what they have done to other women. So being with a man, is ***almost*** a guarantee he's gonna cheat on you. Most hetero women are constantly insecure abt that, but won't say it aloud.  
Then, most men aren't trained to have emotional intelligence. Which makes them unfit to be emotional support. A lot of married women say that they ahve to parent their husbands, be like a second mommy to him, and even constantly protect his fragile ego. Women have to do a lot of coddling when it comes to male ego (we get killed just for rejecting yall).   
Another sign of emotional dysfunction is the rate of domestic violence usually perpetrated by men.

You could argue that men bring love to the table and that they love their gf/wives. But most leave their wives for younger, hotter women as soon as their wives or girlfriend's youth and fertility is gone.Most men on average don't do any housework and treat their wives like a servant. Of course it's changing, but it's still not quite there.What else?...ah yes, sex. But most men can't give an orgasm to their gf/wife and hetero women often complain abt the terrible sexual experiences that they have. And taht's not mentionning porn, and how it's affected het relationships.

If you think about it, men have invented the money system and have made sure women couldn't enter the workforce and get their own money, which made women dependant on men for financial security. because deep down, men KNOW they have nothing else to bring to the table. Women are starting to wake up but the majority by and large are dick worshippers.  üòä

Oh and I forgot to mention, most men aren't even good looking so havign money is the only thing that makes them remotely attractive or desirable. Other than that, if you look at them and their appearance from a purely clinical place...if I were to judge the appearance of the men i see on a daily as harshly as they judge women's faces and bodies...omgüíÄ

edit : Someone raised a valid point that men don't cheat on their wives or gfs as often as they'd like, not because they're loyal or faithful, but because they can't find anyone else to fuck them. That's absolutely true. Men don't get p\*ssy easily like that. They wish tho. That's not because women only go for Chads or ""alphas"" or whatever myths incels and c\*cksuckers like to spread around, it's because the average man is profoundly undesirable. And yes, only money can make the average man seem slightly attractive to economically vulnerable women, but that's it.

So this story takes place during my first deployment. We had this Marine that screwed his life royally.  For this story, I will call him PFC Moron. So PFC Moron meets a girl online while in Iraq. This female convinced PFC Moron to give her access to his bank account. He gave her power of attorney as well because when he got back from Iraq, they would get married. She clearly knew what she was doing. This was not her first rodeo. She cleaned him out, all his money. She then calls our command back in the states and tells them that PFC Moron is harassing her and threatening to kill her. There was even rumors that the Commandant of the Marine Corps heard about this. How and why the Commandant heard about it is a mystery. But the shit storm that came down was not a mystery. They had this poor PFC confined to our sleeping quarters in Iraq. He was not allowed to use the phone, internet. He could not go to the PX. NOTHING! He had to be escorted to the chow hall as well. It turned out after the investigation that he was innocent of threats and apparently, this girl ran this scam a lot. So in the end he lost all his deployment money and came back after our deployment a fucked up PFC.  I remember the libbo brief we got before we went on a 96 right after our return home.

I bought the 2.0 back around April of 2021. Shipping was amazingly quick via DHL to California. It took about 3 days. I prefer speedpads and I have a 35 cm / 360 sensitivity. Immediately I felt the 2.0 was too slow dynamically. Static friction was soso. The 2.0 was also just too loud. The sound of something rubbing on frosted glass was a bit too much. Also the thickness of the pad along with the feet was just too thick and uncomfortable on the forearm.

There was also the issue of the top half of my pad being a different texture than the bottom half. Their machine that adds the texture to the pad must have skipped a pass on the top or bottom, however it works.   I contacted Skypad who said they would take a look at the pad, but I had to pay for shipping back. It was fine with me and I was willing to pay for shipping even though I was sent a defective product. This is until I arrived at the local post office and they quoted me about $70 to ship back! So this wasn't going to happen. I had been in contact with Lethal gaming due to purchasing cables from them in the past and I also saw they were going to start stocking Skypads.  I reached out to them and asked if I could ship the pad to them to verify the pad was defective to Skypad. Lethalgaming is a lot closer to me. They said they were fine with it and Skypad agreed they would give me a refund if Lethalgaming verified the defect.  Out of the generosity of Lethalgaming to get involved and they generously even paid for shipping to them they received the product and verified the uneven texture. Skypad sent me a refund.  


I had kept hearing people all over reddit say how fast their Skypad 2.0's were so I thought maybe I just got a bad copy and went ahead and purchased another one off Amazon. This copy also felt too slow to me. It felt on par with a used Raiden. If both a cloth pad and a glass pad were the same speed, no way would I choose the hard pad that was louder, required an arm sleeeve (I know some of u don't think so), had the occasional screech from dust, and less comfortable. I returned it promptly.  


Almost a year later the Skypad 3.0 was announced touting being smoother, quieter, thinner, and faster so I bought it again. I received it a few days after it started shipping and was pleasantly surprised. It indeed was much faster, quieter, smoother, and thinner. It has very low static friction and dynamic friction. I would say after about 3-4 weeks you will start to notice your mouse slowing down due to the ptfe feet wearing flatter and a larger contact patch forming. It doesn't slow down much though. Dynamic friction seems to slow down more than static friction which remained very good after a month.  Below is a video of how little static friction there is with new feet. The pad was lifted only 1.25"" to achieve a consistent slide from one side to the other.

[https://youtu.be/kyDhezxSw68](https://youtu.be/kyDhezxSw68)

&#x200B;

So the bad part. About a month later I noticed my mouse rattling when I placed it on the left edge of the pad. I checked by placing a different flat object on the left edge which also rattled there but no where else on the pad.  I had been on Skypad's discord for the past month raving on how good the pad was and helping answer questions random users had that I could help answer. I msg'd the owner of Skypad on discord about my issue. The first thing he asked was about the feet under my Skypad. He asked if I changed them. Which I had done. Before I changed the feet I had asked them if they sold their stock feet separately because I noticed if you push on the center of the pad you can see a slight downward flex in the pad and wanted to place some feet in the center. They said they do not. So what I did was take the two bottom feet off and placed one of them at the top middle. I then placed a strip of grip tape along the bottom edge.  So he then says the mouse pad unevenness could be due to the change in feet. I told him the mouse is still perfectly flat on the desk, why would the left edge warp from changing the feet? He then went on to say well I changed the feet and now the pad is altered which voids warranty and that there's nothing he can do to help me and also blaming the warping of the pad due to me changing the feet which makes no sense. Of course he is saying this to avoid any financial loss or damage to reputation. Below is a video of the mouse wobbling on the left edge both with it on the table and then with the pad lifted up. You have to turn to volume up at some points to hear it.

Charlotte and Dana would visit Sasha as she prepared in the locker room belittling and mentally torturing the fighter in an attempt to get the once overconfident Legit Boss to doubt herself and her chances of victory against the devilish duo. When the time came for the match to begin and as Charlotte anticipated her victory to come swiftly, Bayley would return to even the odds by removing Dana from the equation. However, Stephanie was not out of tricks yet as she assigned Summer Rae to back up the queen in a tag match of blonde vixen‚Äôs vs best friends, a match which was soundly overcome by the boss and the hugger when Summer Rae found herself abandoned by the champion. Winning this impromptu situation meant Sasha could set her full focus on getting her title from Charlotte flair as the new number one contender with her best friend Bayley there to watch her back every step of the way. While the boss and the queen set their new plans into motion, Nia Jax isn't going to take the events that transpired laying down and the entire women's division this week is now in her warpath to getting back her ill-gotten right to fight for Charlotte's title.*

**‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ January 23rd Raw in Cleveland, Ohio Quicken Loans Arena** 

After the welcoming video package and the pyro goes off the camera pans around the arena showing the amped up crowd here in Cleveland, Ohio at the Quicken Loans Arena. The audience was on their feet excited to see what new type of twist or turn would happen tonight as there hasn‚Äôt been a single full week since Stephanie has taken over the division and terminated the dull PG guidelines. Michael Cole, Byron and Corey Graves welcome us in but before they could get to in-depth on what to expect tonight, Sasha‚Äôs Sky‚Äôs The Limit filled the arena.   
  
Cole: ‚ÄúOh you know what that means Corey‚Ä¶‚Äù  
  
Graves: ‚ÄúNo please don‚Äôt Michael.‚Äù  
  
Cole: ‚ÄúIT‚ÄôS BOSS TIME!‚Äù   
  
Graves: ‚ÄúUgh, I was really looking forward to Charlotte putting that egomaniac in her place last week, so I‚Äôd never have to hear that ridiculous catch phrase of hers you shout like a lunatic every week.‚Äù  
  
Byron: ‚ÄúWhat are you talking about Corey? Just admit it you just can‚Äôt handle the fact that without Dana‚Äôs help Sasha and Bayley were able to beat Charlotte last week.‚Äù  
  
Corey: ‚ÄúBeat Charlotte, are you blind Byron? They did no such thing as the Queen made a strategic play to stop participating in a match that she had no reason to be in any way. I mean a non-title match against that Backstabber is completely beneath the Queen. Just like continuing this ridiculous conversation with you is beneath me.‚Äù  
  
The crowd were all on their feet loudly cheering for the Legit Boss as she made her way out onto the stage, this time with her old arrogance and swagger as she was feeling great about herself after what she was able to accomplish last week.   
  
[Sasha strutted down to the ring](https://www.wwe.com/shows/wwebattleground/2016/gallery/sasha-banks-bayley-charlotte-dana-brooke-photos#fid-40038020) with a cocky little grin on her face and got an even greater boost of confidence looking at the happy faces in the crowd along with a few signs that were saying stuff like ‚ÄúCharlotte Fears The Legit Boss‚Äù and a few humiliating Nia Jax signs. All of this turned that cocky little grin into a big proud smile as she high fived some of the fans and even placed her Boss shades on a young girl in the audience as she hyped up the crowd while swaggering down to the ring. Once on the apron Sasha grabbed the middle rope and leaned forward making sure the camera down below got a good look at her rings that said ‚ÄòBOSS‚Äô   
  
Sasha: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right the Boss is here.‚Äù She boasted before entering the ring.  
  
Now in the ring wearing her vibrant blue and yellow gear with pink accents and black jacket, the Legit Boss quickly grabbed a mic, took a quick lap around the squared circle before standing front and center giving the crowd a playful little booty shimmy and push em all out the way hip swivel to a large ovation. Sasha couldn‚Äôt help but smile as the crowd loudly cheered and whistles for her as her music faded away.

Sasha: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up Cleveland!‚Äù  
  
The crowd let out a thunderous roar as they marked out for their hometown. The reaction was even louder than expected and caused Sasha to mouth the words ‚ÄòWow‚Äô with an impressed smile on her face. Just based off that reaction alone Sasha immediately knew that this crowd was special tonight.   
  
Sasha: ‚ÄúLast week, I challenged Charlotte to a championship match, and she did what she does best and that‚Äôs run away. She was a coward, who tucked her tail and ran because she is afraid of me and knows that she can‚Äôt beat me in a fair fight.‚Äù  
  
The crowd started to cheer loudly at Sasha‚Äôs passionate words and chant ‚ÄúCharlotte‚Äôs a Coward‚Äù at the top of their lungs. The Cleveland crowds loud cheering caused the Legit Boss to pause for a moment as she soaked in the atmosphere and gave the camera a sly smirk before pointing at her ear asking Charlotte through the lens if she could hear what the fans were chanting. Then once the chants started to die down a bit Sasha continued with her verbal assassination of The Queen.  
  
Sasha: ‚ÄúWithout the help of your Daddy, that little Pitbull you call a prot√©g√© or your new servant you would never be champion. All you are Charlotte is a fake. And now there is nowhere left for you to run because I‚Äôm the number one contender and I promise you and the entire world why I will be the face of this women‚Äôs division when I take back my WWE women‚Äôs championship!‚Äù   
  
The crowd was on their feet applauding Sasha and chanting for the Legit Boss due to the passionate words that she had just spoken and their desire for her to regain the title. But, after a few moments of cheering everyone, was stunned and confused, yet happy when they heard Bayley‚Äôs music fill the arena. [Bayley came out onto the stage](https://static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Bayley-8.jpg) smiling as she pointed and looked out into the crowd, but once her eyes locked with Sasha‚Äôs her smile faded and turned to a more serious gaze. As she stood on stage for a moment, Sasha innocently questioned what Bayley was doing out here. Sasha was expecting Charlotte to come out and respond to her words or throw down the gauntlet for a title match right now. After a moment Bayley made her way down to the ring still making sure to high five and give out some hugs to the fans in the audience but never once taking her attention off Sasha. 

Once in the ring Bayley quickly grabbed a microphone of her own and stood toe to toe with the Legit Boss clad in her red and yellow wrestling gear. Sasha wondered why Bayley was out here, did she just want to show support to her best friend before she goes through with another title match with Charlotte? Did she want to get something off her chest? Did she want to wrestle her? Or was Bayley here to stab her in the back? All these thoughts and more raced through Sasha‚Äôs mind as Bayley continued to just almost coldly stare her down. Sasha immediately shook her head getting the idea of Bayley, her best friend turning on her out of her mind, but she was still conflicted about how to react. As the anticipation in the building began to swell Sasha decided to tread carefully as she raised the microphone up to her lips but before she could say anything Bayley cut her off.  
  
Bayley: ‚ÄúLook Sasha, before you say anything I just want you to know that you‚Äôre like a sister to me and that I‚Äôll always have your back. You know that right?‚Äù Feeling the emotion and weight of Bayley‚Äôs words Sasha nodded in agreement as deep down felt the same way about Bayley. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why it‚Äôs hard for me to say this but I don‚Äôt think you should be the number one contender, I should be.‚Äù  
  
Sasha was completely gob smacked by Bayley‚Äôs sudden declaration that she should be the number one contender and not her. In a rare occurrence the Legit Boss was actually left speechless. Sasha‚Äôs eyes darted around while trying to process this information.  
  
Sasha: ‚ÄúUh what are talking about Bayley, I won last week which means that I should be the number one contender.‚Äù She questioned in the nicest way she could.  
  
Bayley: ‚ÄúYeah but you‚Äôre not the one who pinned Summer last week to win the match, I am. So, I think if anyone should be the number one contender around here it should be me.‚Äù  
  
Sasha honestly couldn‚Äôt believe what she was hearing from her best friend. Bayley knows how important this rematch with Charlotte is for her so why would she suddenly do this after she earned the opportunity fair and square last week. This was quickly becoming a delicate situation as Sasha wanted to respect her friend but also let her know who the Boss is.   
  
Sasha: ‚ÄúLook Bayley, nobody knows better than me just how talented you are and how deserving you are to be women‚Äôs champion. But I just don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôre ready yet to confront Charlotte after what she did to you last time. And I don‚Äôt ever wanna see anything like that happen to you again.‚Äù she stated in an over-the-top concerned voice that sounded fake to Bayley as Sasha gave her a reassuring pat on her cleavage.   
  
Bayley was clearly not pleased with the way Sasha was treating her and pressed her tongue against the inside of her cheek while shaking her head in disbelief. Bayley couldn‚Äôt help but let a bit of an annoyed laugh out from under her breath as she knew what Sasha was doing and wasn‚Äôt going to let it slide.  
  
Bayley: ‚ÄúWow Sasha I really appreciate your concern it means so much coming from the Legit Boss of WWE.‚Äù Bayley said with fake sincerity in her voice as she slowly reached out and lightly grasps the main medallion part of Sasha‚Äôs Legit Boss necklace between her fingers before giving it a light disrespectful flip. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm more than ready to face Charlotte. But if it‚Äôs you that ends up facing Charlotte, I‚Äôll be right there to help make sure that they don‚Äôt cheat or strip you down and put you on display again. Because like I said you know that I‚Äôll always have your back, right Legit Boss?‚Äù She antagonistically stated as she reached out delivering a few firm pats to Sasha‚Äôs Legit Boss necklace that laid across her soft cleavage.  
  
Bayley‚Äôs clear passive aggressive response drew loud Ooo‚Äôs from the crowd as Sasha was now the one shaking her head and letting out a frustrated laughter from under her breath. Sasha wanted to keep things civil with her best friend but her competitive and alpha nature just wouldn‚Äôt let things slide. Bayley had returned fire to Sasha leaving the Legit Boss with a frustrated glare. Not one for being shown up Sasha took a commanding step forward so that they were now practically chest to chest before flashing an insincere smirk.   
  
Sasha: ‚ÄúThank you Bayley, I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôd do without my precious little role model watching over me.‚Äù she says with such a condescending attitude as she pats Bayley on the top of her head like a dog before disrespectfully snapping Bayley‚Äôs headband against the side of her head.  
  
Tensions were clearly starting to run hot between the two friends as they stared intensely at each other, both refusing to back down from the other and their conviction that they should be facing Charlotte for that title next. A loud hum filled the arena as the audience was on the edge of their seat wondering if the two former rivals and now best friends were about to come to blows and settle things right here and now, but before it came to any of that Nia Jax‚Äôs Force of Greatness theme loudly blared through the arena. Sasha immediately rolled her eyes and turned her body to the side so that she could see as the [Irresistible force made her way out onto the stage](https://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/2016-12-26/gallery/nia-jax-vs-scarlett-photos#fid-40075614) with a microphone in hand.

Nia: ‚ÄúUgh, would you two stop with the passive aggressive mean girls schtick and just kiss already. I mean that‚Äôs all any of these people really care about when it comes to you two now.‚Äù Nia taunted as she slowly made her way down to the ring.  
  
Sasha clearly being in no mood for any of Nia‚Äôs games, turns her head back towards Bayley giving her best friend a quick glance and nod to sort of indicate a cease fire / truce which Bayley returns in kind before both turn to face the ramp.   
  
Sasha: ‚ÄúNia why don‚Äôt you shut the hell up before I send you back to catering where you belong.‚Äù  
  
Nia: ‚ÄúOh such tough talk from such a little girl. What are you all brave now that you got your little girlfriend out here to back you up, hmm is that it Sasha, not boss enough to handle business on your own?‚Äù  
  
Sasha: ‚ÄúYou must have lost your damn mind, I don‚Äôt need anyone‚Äôs help, especially not to deal with someone like you. Because in case you forgot I‚Äôm the Boss that laid out your fat ass last week and Earned being the number one contender.‚Äù Sasha passionately stated clearly being lost in the moment. And as soon as those words left her the camera immediately panned over to Bayley catching the agitated glare she had on her face.  
  
Nia: ‚ÄúWah, Wah, Wah. Do you ever shut up Sasha?‚Äù Just like always you‚Äôre not happy unless you‚Äôre the center of attention.‚Äù  
  
Sasha from inside the ring just arrogantly boasts to Nia ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs Right‚Äù as she confidently sways her hips from side to side and sensually moves her hands up and down her body to emphasize her point to Nia. Jax just bit her lip in frustration clearly aggravated by the Legit Bosses pride and arrogance in herself. Bayley still watching couldn‚Äôt help but flash a little smile towards her best friends‚Äô actions and admire the confidence that she had in herself and in her body.  
  
Nia: ‚ÄúLook you two can bicker about who the number one contender is all day until your both blue in the face for all I care but, the fact of the matter is that there is only one person here that should be the number one contender, and that‚Äôs me. And if either of you losers feel like trying to stop me, I'd be more than happy to run through you and leave you both broken and exposed like the pathetic little sluts you are.""  
  
Sasha: ‚ÄúOh really?‚Äù Sasha says in a very sarcastic and dismissive tone, which Nia clearly didn‚Äôt take kindly too as she steps into the ring completely unafraid of the two on one advantage currently facing her at the moment.  
  
Nia: ‚ÄúThere is a 300-pound Samoan standing right in front of you that can rip your face off. No, no, no I could break your face. So, why don‚Äôt you shut up and get in line behind me where you belong.‚Äù Nia demands as she disrespectfully turns her body away from Sasha and points behind herself while making a short clicking or kissing noise, like someone letting a horse know it‚Äôs time to get going. ‚ÄúBack there.‚Äù  
  
Sasha: ‚ÄúBitch What line!‚Äù With unmatched levels of attitude in her voice, which caused the entire Cleveland crowd to all reacted with louds ooohs. ‚ÄúWhere standing in a ring, and I will face you right here and right now, Winner faces Charlotte at the Rumble.‚Äù Sasha confidently declares as she clicks her tongue at Nia while throwing her ‚ÄòLEGIT BOSS‚Äô rings down onto the mat and taking her jacket off to emphasize her point and get ready for a fight.  
  
Sasha and Nia then got nose to nose with neither woman backing down as Bayley stood a bit to the side with a concerned look on her face knowing what Nia has done to Sasha and herself in the past. But even though Bayley had a look of concern if one looked closely, they could see the frustration growing in her eyes as she was hurt by Sasha sort of dismissing her as a potential number one contender and not including her in the challenge too Nia.   
  
The two alpha females were about to come to blows when suddenly another interruption occurred as Charlotte Flair‚Äôs music trumpeted through the Quicken Loans Arena. [The Queen came out dressed classy in a white blazer](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/33/39/d9/3339d9f9822e2baff6649493d09f1315.jpg), tight fitting snakeskin top, black business shorts, and of course her Raw Women‚Äôs Championship front and center around her slender waist. Her two loyal subjects Dana and Renee accompanied her out onto the stage with each one standing on a side of her. [Dana was decked out in all black attire](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CRcB-f3UkAATcRo.jpg) from her tight pants to her tube top to her jagged necklace. And [Renee was dressed to match her queen](https://preview.redd.it/ocligjli72b81.png?width=672&format=png&auto=webp&s=37448cd7616c109b5f909255b7b677a574f72aef) in a tight-fitting matching snakeskin bodysuit that hugged her body so tightly that it was partially see through as it showed off every one of the dirty blonde‚Äôs heavenly curves. The sexy former respected reporter also wore a pair of black knee-high boots, and of course her ‚ÄòQueen‚Äôs Slave‚Äô collar.

Charlotte: ‚ÄúSasha, Sasha, Sasha you‚Äôre not deserving of being the number one contender for My title. And I don‚Äôt know how you can stand there and call me a coward when you‚Äôre the one who found a way out of her number one contender‚Äôs match last week. I mean I don‚Äôt blame you; I might be afraid to face Nia too if she had been able to expose me and beat me into submission both in the ring and in the women‚Äôs locker room.‚Äù Charlotte said with a snide sneer as Sasha‚Äôs face began to turn red with embarrassment and anger.   
  
Sasha: ‚ÄúCharlotte why don‚Äôt you stop talking and step into this ring with me so I can prove to you that I‚Äôm the best and show you what real submission is.‚Äù  
  
Charlotte just disrespectfully laughed off Sasha‚Äôs remarks like the former champion was completely beneath her.   
  
Charlotte: ‚ÄúTrust me Sasha if I step into that ring with you, especially if it‚Äôs for this belt, the only one who will be submitting is you. Or do you not remember what happened to you at Roadblock?‚Äù   
  
Sasha had no real response for Charlotte as all she could do was scrunch her face in disgust and frustratingly pout her lips as she watched Dana Brooke annoyingly mock what they had did to her by outstretching her arms, slightly bending her knees, and feigning a pleading look in her eyes as she mocked Sasha‚Äôs begging when she was strung up and gagged on the apron at Roadblock. Dana‚Äôs little play put a big smile on the Queen‚Äôs face and amused her, but Charlotte wasn‚Äôt the only one amused as Nia couldn‚Äôt help but joyfully laugh at Dana‚Äôs depiction of the so-called Legit Boss as well.   
  
Charlotte: ‚ÄúAnd you know what now that I think about it, none of you are worthy challengers.‚Äù The Queen cackles with a big smile on her face to the loud boos of the crowd while Dana wags her finger no at the three women standing in the ring. ‚ÄúI mean Sasha you‚Äôre a bigger disgrace to the WWE then the Browns are to Cleveland!‚Äù Charlotte loudly stated garnering cheap loud boos from the Cleveland audience. ‚ÄúAnd besides ratchet wannabe wrestlers have no business being in the ring with wrestling royalty like me unless it‚Äôs to bow at my feet.‚Äù  
  
Sasha was pissed at the Queen‚Äôs blatant disrespect for her and started to shout and mover her head along with her goading words calling for Charlotte to get her ass in the ring. However, the Queen just laughed her off and dismissed her with a simple wave of her hand.   
  
Charlotte: ‚ÄúAnd Bayley, you may have fluked into a pin over Summer last week but your still nothing more than the abject failure and fool I exposed you for. So, I suggest you take that big ass of yours out of here before I remind you who‚Äôs bitch you are and retire you for good this time.‚Äù  
  
After those scathing words Sasha looked over at her best friend seeing how she would respond, but unlike her Bayley‚Äôs reaction was much more reserved as she just stared daggers at Charlotte with a bit of a pouting expression on her face. The Queen returned proud smirk of her own to Bayley as the two locked eyes for a moment. The Queen then let out a little self-assured chuckle before moving her attention over to the destructive force known as Nia Jax.  
  
Charlotte: ‚ÄúOh, and Nia, you did such a good job humiliating our little ratchet slut in the locker room a few weeks ago, but after last week I think you‚Äôre more ready for catering than a shot at my women‚Äôs championship. Hahaha.""  
  
Nia‚Äôs joyful laughing had now been turned to stone silence as she glared up the ramp at Charlotte. The irresistible force now had a deadly serious and pissed off look on her face as she took an intimidating step forward towards the ropes. It appeared like Nia was mere moments away from charging up the ramp and breaking the arrogant Queen in half as Charlotte and Dana cackled at the top of the ramp like a couple of hyaenas.  
  
The three women stood in the ring each with a look of disgust and frustration on their faces as they no longer wanted to kill each other now but wanted to murder the Queen. Then as the Queen and her subjects, stood proudly at the top of the ramp with big arrogant grins Stephanie McMahon‚Äôs music suddenly began to play. Charlotte and Dana quickly ceased their laughing as the [GM of the women‚Äôs division walked out onto the stage](https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_14/3463021/stephanie.jpg) dressed in an elegant navy-blue dress. 

Stephanie: ‚ÄúExcuse me did I just hear you correct Charlotte? Did you say that none of these women are fit to challenge you for the title?‚Äù  
  
Charlotte: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right not a single one of them is worthy to challenge the Queen, Wooooooo.‚Äù  
  
Stephanie: ‚ÄúWell it‚Äôs a good thing it doesn‚Äôt matter what you think then because in my eyes they are all worthy challengers for your women‚Äôs championship.‚Äù  
  
The crowd began to loudly cheer in approval too Mrs. McMahon‚Äôs surprising response as Charlotte and Dana began to freak out and yell at the fans to shut up.  
  
Charlotte: ‚ÄúNo, you can‚Äôt do this to me I‚Äôm the Queen, I‚Äôm the Champion.‚Äù Charlotte frantically exclaimed while poking herself in the chest.   
  
Stephanie: ‚ÄúSHUT UP!‚Äù Stephanie roared right in Charlotte‚Äôs face, which quickly got her and her little lackey to stop freaking out and be still. ‚ÄúNow I suggest you keep that mouth of yours shut before I teach you the same lesson, I taught that blow up doll of yours that you call a prot√©g√©.‚Äù She said with such authority in her voice that Charlotte was taken a back and felt like she had no choice but to bite her tongue.   
  
Seeing this put a pleased expression on the Billion Dollar Princesses face and a sense of calm washed over her before she turned to address the three superstars standing in the ring.   
  
Stephanie: ‚ÄúGood because I wasn‚Äôt finished talking yet. Now although I think you are all worthy challengers there can only be One number one contender, so I‚Äôve decided that at the Royal Rumble you three will fight for the privilege to face the WWE Raw Women‚Äôs champion. And because I‚Äôm nothing if not a fair leader, there will be a beat the clock challenge tonight involving you three ladies and the winner will get to pick the stipulation for the triple threat match at the Rumble. However, tonight I‚Äôll be picking the stipulations for each and every one of your matches and I promise that from now on go home shows will be a lot more‚Ä¶exciting.‚Äù She said with a classic evil McMahon grin.  
  
Each of the three competitors in the ring began to cautiously look each other up and down, sizing up their opponents when to the shock of everyone the sound of a piano sounded though the arena before the words Emmalina appeared on screen in bright letters and her music began to play. 

Corey: ‚ÄúOh my god, oh my god, oh my god.‚Äù  
  
Byron: ‚ÄúTry to contain yourself Co‚Ä¶‚Äù  
  
Corey: ‚ÄúShut up Saxton don‚Äôt ruin this for me!‚Äù  
  
Everyone including Stephanie had a quizzical look on their face as the stunning Australian bombshell made her way out onto the stage with a conceited look on her face. The previously referred to [Emma was dressed in a stunning flesh colored dress](https://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/2017-02-13/gallery/emmalina-finally-premieres-photos#fid-40085576) that was covered in gems along with a pair of sexy heels that made her smooth toned legs stand out more than normal.  
  
Corey: ‚ÄúGood god in heaven after months of waiting she has arrived.‚Äù  
  
As soon as the music died down the fans in the crowd began to loudly whistle at the gorgeous woman standing in front of them with her back arched and her hand on her hip. But not everyone was impressed or happy to see her as Stephanie shot the newly christened Emmalina a cross look despising the fact that she had just been interrupted yet again. 

Emma: ‚ÄúFor 14 weeks you have waited for the makeover of Emma to Emmalina.‚Äù She exclaimed with a cute giggle to the end of her words. ‚ÄúWell, here I am.‚Äù She vainly stated while holding out her arms and drinking in the crowd‚Äôs positive reaction. However, it appeared as though Stephanie was getting tired of waiting as she placed her hands on her hips and began aggressively tapping with her pointer finger. Emma glanced over her shoulder and gave the annoyed GM a haughty little smirk before turning her attention back to the crowd. ‚ÄúAnd now you will all see the transformation of Emmalina to Emma.‚Äù  
  
Corey: ‚ÄúWait what did she just say?‚Äù  
  
Everyone in the building was completely dumbfounded by Emma‚Äôs announcement from the audience to competitors standing in the ring.   
  
Emma: ‚ÄúBecause you see from now on it‚Äôs all about Me. I sat back there for four bloody months waiting for my chance while that horsed face slut and pathetic fan girl failed over and over and over again. Well, I‚Äôm done waiting. Charlotte wants a worthy challenger for a change than that‚Äôs me. So, Stephanie do the fair thing and make me the number one contender. Or are you full of hot air like your father?‚Äù  
  
Stephanie: ‚ÄúLook I don‚Äôt know who you think you are, but I run this show not you. And if you don‚Äôt show me the respect that I deserve then maybe we‚Äôll have to take a trip to my office so I can give your big ass the proper attention it deserves.‚Äù Stephanie venomously stated as she got right up in Emma‚Äôs face. However, Emma was unafraid of her boss even as she loomed over her which was strangely something Stephanie could respect as her lips curled into a smirk for a second before reverting back to her normal scowl. ‚ÄúHmph, you want all eyes on you and wanna be the number one contender than you‚Äôll have to prove it, tonight.‚Äù   
  
Emma couldn‚Äôt help but flash a satisfied smirk as she was about to get the opportunity she sought. Stephanie gaze lingered on Emma for a moment before she quickly snapped her gaze back to the ring and focused in on Bayley with evil intentions in mind.    
  
Stephanie: ""Now Bayley, clearly you weren't listening to the offer I made to you a couple weeks ago as you‚Äôre still paling around with backstabbing trash like our little legit slut over here. But just like I‚Äôm giving Emma a chance I‚Äôm going to give you another chance as well. So tonight, it‚Äôll be Bayley vs Emma with the winner moving on to the Royal Rumble.‚Äù   
  
Immediately after making the announcement Bayley and Emma locked eyes with each other each sporting their own excited smile for the match. Emma sought to take the spotlight that she viewed was hers as Bayley sought to redeem herself for what happened two weeks ago and get one step closer to becoming champion. However, Stephanie wasn‚Äôt finished making her announcement just yet.  
  
Stephanie: ‚ÄúHowever, this won‚Äôt be just a regular one on one match. You see I need to know that whoever‚Äôs going to the Rumble has that fire and is willing to be whatever it takes to grab that brass ring. I promised that go home shows would now be a lot more exciting from now on and I‚Äôm a woman of my word. So, tonight it‚Äôll be Bayley vs Emma in a paddle on a pole match!‚Äù She proudly exclaimed with an evil grin while starring right at Bayley.  
  
  
  
Bayley‚Äôs childlike enthusiasm quickly dimmed into a somber glare as she slowly looked over at Emma who was confidently rubbing her hands together. Emma noticed Bayley staring at her and gave her a little eyebrow flash to let her know that she‚Äôs excited to paddle Bayley‚Äôs ass back to irrelevancy. After lingering on Emma for a bit Bayley‚Äôs gaze moved to meet Stephanie‚Äôs. The two had very different expressions but each knew exactly what was going on without having to say a word. As the two stared at each other Sasha started to sport a genuinely concerned look for her friend but was unsure how to act. Noticing this and believing she had gotten her message across to Bayley shifted her focus to the legit pain in her ass.  
  
Stephanie: ""Now Sasha I can see that you are terribly worried about your little friend, but I suggest worrying about yourself because your opponent tonight is Dana Brooke. And don't you worry Sasha, this is going to be a normal wrestling match where the winner is determined by pinfall or submission. But seeing as how comfortable both you and Dana are parading around in front of the WWE universe in your bra and panties the match will be contested with each of you starting out already dressed that way. So, I hope you packed something...special, for the occasion Miss Banks. I mean you wouldn‚Äôt want to let your little Krew down now, would you?""  
  
Sasha just stewed with anger as she shot Stephanie a dirty scowl completely ignoring Dana who was arrogantly boasting and flexing at the top of the ramp. Sasha was completely confident in her body and knew she would have no trouble beating Dana but the fact that she is being forced to wrestle in her bra and panties like some Diva disgusted her. Not only that but Sasha felt that Dana was beneath her and a waste of her time as the women she really wanted to get her hands on is Charlotte. Watching Sasha squirm inside the put a big smile on Stephanie‚Äôs face as she couldn‚Äôt stand the Legit Boss. After a few joyful moments Stephanie finally turned her attention to the most imposing figure in the ring Nia Jax.  
  
Stephanie: ‚ÄúAnd finally we have the Irresistible Force Nia Jax, the so-called monster of the women's division who's so tough, so unstoppable that she can run through any two women put in front of her in her path to getting the title. Well, we are going to put that claim to the test because tonight it‚Äôll be Nia Jax in a 2 on 1 handicap match against the opponents of my choosing. And since I love that aggressive side, you have displayed so often when dealing with Sasha I‚Äôm going to make this match a no disqualification match. So, don‚Äôt disappoint me, Nia.‚Äù  
  
Nia just gave her Boss an eager smirk as she punched the palm of her hand excited at the opportunity to have the handcuffs off and let off some steam against not one but two women.   
  
Stephanie: ‚ÄúOh and Emma, I suggest you get ready because your match with Bayley is up first. Now good luck I‚Äôll be watching.‚Äù  
  
SMACK!  
  
Emma jumped in place and her eyes went wide as she felt a sharp sting in her sizeable rear as Stephanie had just given her a firm slap to the ass. Emma reached back to rub her throbbing cheek and looked over her should with an incredulous expression as she watched her Boss proudly sauntering to the back without ever giving her a second glance to the sound of her Welcome to the Queendom theme music. As Stephanie‚Äôs music continued to play the camera quickly panned to each of the competitors faces before fading to a commercial break.

‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

It‚Äôs a little later in the show and now back from a commercial break it was time for the match between Bayley and Emma. During the commercial break the production crew had set up the pole in the far corner of the ring closest to the announce desk and hooked the paddle to the top of the poll so that it was now dangling in the air. With everything set up all that was left was for the participants to make their entrances.   
  
The crowd was buzzing with excitement anxious to see how this match would turn out. Would Bayley be able to redeem herself and take one step closer to her dream of becoming WWE champion or would the self-centered Emma take what she views to be hers and shatter those dreams of Bayley‚Äôs and spank her ass back to into Sasha‚Äôs shadow?  
  
With the crowd buzzing it‚Äôs Bayley‚Äôs music that breaks the silence and brings the crowd to their feet. Bayley came running and spinning out onto the stage overflowing with energy as sent a big hug to the left side of the stage then the right side before standing in the middle and raising her hands up to summon up her colorful wacky waving inflatable tube men. Bayley was clearly filled with joy as she saw all her fans smiling and clapping along to her theme which melted away most of the frustration she had earlier.   
  
On her way down to the ring Bayley high fived and hugged some of her fans, but the closer she got to the ring the more butterflies started to fill her stomach. Yes, Bayley was excited to redeem herself, but she had nothing against Emma and had no desire to paddle her ass. The only target Bayley had was Charlotte. However, she knew what was at stake and couldn‚Äôt afford to lose, in fact she refused to lose again.  
  
Once in the ring Bayley loaded up before sending out a hug to the hard camera side of the arena by out stretching her arms to the crowd. Bayley gently nodded her head to her theme with a smile as she began to remove her jacket but when her eyes fell upon the pole in the corner and the paddle hanging above her smile slowly began to fade. Thoughts of doubt slowly began to creep into her mind and as she starred at the ominous spanking device, she noticed that Stephanie had made this a special paddle as it was branded with the word ‚ÄòLOSER‚Äô across it. Bayley became lost in thought as she furrowed her brow looking at the paddle as it did nothing but bring back bad memories and feelings of insecurity.   
  
Soon Emma‚Äôs bee boo bopping of her Real Deal theme song snapped Bayley out of her trace and brought her back to reality as she turned to see [Emma make her entrance](https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/c/b5/cb58c7b4-44a4-11e8-bb13-db97fa2db341/5ad9f606cb26e.image.jpg?resize=1200%2C800). The Australian bombshell walked out onto the stage dressed in her black and blue attire before hitting center stage and turning her back to the ramp as she snapped her hips to each of the loud beats of her theme song. Once the song mellowed out Emma then confidently threw her hair over her shoulder and strutted down to the ring. Unlike Bayley, Emma was having no second thoughts and was completely sure of herself in fact she relished the opportunity to paddle Bayley‚Äôs big ass out of the title picture and her rightful spot.  
  
Emma: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right it‚Äôs all about Me now!‚Äù

Once on the apron Emma sensually and slowly slid her hands down the middle rope before enticingly laying her body across it with one leg completely outstretched. The Cleveland crowd couldn‚Äôt help themselves as they began to whistle and cat call in approval of Emma‚Äôs provocative actions. The once adorable dancing girl flashed a snobbish smirk at the crowd before finally entering the ring and once again snapping her hips to the music as she confidently looked right at the unsure Bayley.  
  
Emma: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm taking it all tonight. And that includes making that fat loser ass of yours sore tonight.‚Äù Emma said in a self-assured tone as she slowly shifted her gaze up to the paddle causing Bayley‚Äôs eyes to follow suit. After a few moments of staring both competitors took a step back and allowed JOJO into the spotlight so she could explain the rules and get the match underway.  
  
JOJO: ‚ÄúThe following contest will be a paddle on a pole match!‚Äù  
  
Fans cheered at JOJO‚Äôs introduction to the match as they were excited to see which of these two bubble butt beauties would get their lovely ass paddled out of the Rumble match. Also, the crowd was interested to see if there would be anything special instore for the loser since Stephanie promised to make the go home shows more exciting.   
  
JOJO: ‚ÄúThe match rules are as follows: The object of the match is to be the first women to grab the paddle hanging from the top of the pole. To win all a competitor must do is pull down and secure the paddle. Once someone has retrieved the paddle, they will be declared the winner and the losing competitor must allow the winner to use the paddle to spank their ass.‚Äù  
  
With the participant introductions and explanation of the rules all out of the JOJO exited the ring and the ref called for the bell.  
  
DING DING DING!

At the sound of the bell the two opponents size each other up a bit before Emma starts to confidently walk towards Bayley wearing a mischievous smile. Emma‚Äôs brash actions threw Bayley a bit off her game, so she decided to take the cautious approach and wait for Emma to make the first move.  
  
Emma: ‚ÄúPoor poor Bayley, having to stand there and compare yourself to the goddess standing across from you. Don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôll make sure you give everyone here a good show, once I get these babies out again.‚Äù Emma says with a confident almost erotic tone as she reaches out and pinches Bayley‚Äôs busty chest.   
  
Bayley squeals in shock as she swats Emma‚Äôs hand away and charges after her opponent. Emma quickly escapes out of the ring sprinting around the squared circle with Bayley in hot pursuit. However, this was all part of the clever Aussie‚Äôs plan as she slipped back into the ring and immediately turned around and got the jump on Bayley landing heavy rights and lefts to the former NXT champions back. Maintaining her advantage Emma grabs a handful of Bayley‚Äôs hair and slams her head down hard into the canvas. With Bayley crawling on the mat trying to regain her barring‚Äôs Emma begins to smack the back of the Hugger‚Äôs dazed head and let her know that it‚Äôs all about Emma now.  
  
Emma: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre five minutes of fame is over Bayley. You don‚Äôt deserve to be here loser, and I‚Äôm going to paddle that big bum of yours back to obscurity where you belong.‚Äù  
  
After one last hard smack Bayley collapses down onto the floor as Emma raises to her feet and holds her arms out laughing at the pitiful state of her opponent.   
  
Emma: ‚ÄúIs this the best you can do Bayley? Pft you‚Äôre even more pathetic than these little ankle bitters you call fans.‚Äù  
  
The cocky brunette made her way to the front of Bayley and just as Bayley reached her hand out to help herself get to her feet Emma placed her boot on the Hugger‚Äôs hand and began to grind it into the mat. Bayley whaled in pain as she desperately tried to free her hand. Meanwhile Emma just sadistically laughed as the Hugger struggled under her boot. After a few more seconds of torture Emma stomped her foot down hard on Bayley‚Äôs now injured hand. The normally jovial Hugger was in a world of pain as she clutched her hand to her chest.  
  
Graves: ‚ÄúThis is absolutely brilliant if Emma is able to incapacitate Bayley‚Äôs hand, she won‚Äôt be able to retrieve the paddle and win the match.‚Äù  
  
Byron: ‚ÄúAs much as I hate to admit it you're right Corey.‚Äù  
  
Graves: ‚ÄúOf course I‚Äôm right you idiot, and the sooner that you realize that I‚Äôm always right the smarter you‚Äôll start to look Byron.‚Äù

The new apartment is great, but I got a call from the landlord that he barks incessantly, from 7:30am to noon and 12:30pm till I get home. Now I am toting him around, as my work is ok with me for now at my side, but he needs to relax. 

I have tried to distance myself from him a bit, because as a doxie, he‚Äôs a constant shadow and momma‚Äôs boy. I don‚Äôt greet him when I get home, bought an anti bark device and vibrating anti bark collar, both of which he goes at a higher pitch or just barks through. I‚Äôve caged off half the apartment and when I work from home, he is ok, but as soon as I put the keys in to lock, he starts up again. I‚Äôve been trying to leave for short periods to help get him used to it, but I am not sure if it‚Äôs getting through to him. He gets the tv and white noise in the background. 

I am desperate for suggestions, and no, I can‚Äôt work from home all the time. I am nervous to go out and get groceries for fear he starts up. I also don‚Äôt want to get a second animal just to placate him. He‚Äôs very sweet, sensitive boy outside this barking, and my best friend.

Looking for another type of cheese? Try looking on completely different aisle! Still can't find the cheese you want?

I hope your five year old doesn't want bologna for lunch tomorrow because it will take you a week to track it down in Butt's Labyrinth. Riddles around every corner! To add to the absurdity the store is only 80% stocked. Is your item not carried in this store, in another part of the store, or simply out? You'll never know!

I‚Äôm not really sure if this is normal or not. Is there much difference between fucking and making love from a guys perspective?

s40ghv,"Hey fellow redditors, my BF(31) and I(33) have been together for the past 3.5 years and living happily together for the past 2 with our 4 awesome dogs. In November we agreed that we want to get married in 2022. Being the procative (impatient? lol) dude that I am, I took the lead and bought an engagement ring for my dude (had it custom made and I think he will really dig it) and I'm planning to propose during our upcoming trip to DisneyWorld/Universal Studios (we are both huge theme park junkies).

TBH my idea was to just give him the ring and pop the question when I found a good ""romantic"" moment during one of our park-hopping days... maybe at dinner? or while taking a walk in anot so crowded area in one of the parks? however, when I told my close friends my plan (female and male, both straight) they seemed VERY surprised that I had not planned ahead a ""big way to propose"" while we are at Disney... they asked me if I had hired a photographer to ""capture the proposal"" and if I had ""something special prepared"" even suggested that I had special arrangements made to pop the question in a big romantic way (like having the question on a board, hiring a mime to be my accomplice, or things like that)... they later tried to downplay it and said that isnt' important as long as we love each other etc... but I was left wondering if I should be planning something bigger? I mean the trip to Florida in itself is ""the big moment"", as we do not live in the U.S.

Anywho, what are your thoughts? would you have bigger expectations if it were you? should a proposal always be made ""an event""? providing money/time is not a factor. Thanks!

**tl;dr:** Proposing to my BF during a trip to Disney next week, friends think I should aim for a big romantic proposal/moment and not just pop the question/hand him the ring.

Edit: We are not reserved or introverts, more outgoing actually, Bf is  ‚Äúfun-loving‚Äù type of person but we are also not big on flashy and over the top public moments particularly if it feels ‚Äústaged‚Äù.

rysmpy,"I want to preface this by saying, I absolutely adore the art on this sub and think everybody‚Äôs interpretation of the characters are amazing in their own special way and that most of these artists do better than I think I could ever do. It‚Äôs so cool, that I use it to help myself learn how to draw in my day to day life! 
That being said, it always irks me a little, how big a size difference artists always seem to make in relation to Haru and Legosi. Like I completely understand that they‚Äôre fictional characters and that it couldn‚Äôt matter less, but for some reason it just seems odd. Like, it‚Äôs cannon that she‚Äôs a little more than half his size, like, in *that* scene in the anime when they first met, she still had to get down a little bit a to try to do anything with him. 
In the books, I‚Äôd wager to say she‚Äôs roughly the same size(?) It just always seems weird cuz she‚Äôs always like knee hight in most artists renditions, and that‚Äôs just like, toddler sized compared to him and it just looks creepy. Maybe it‚Äôs to crank up the cute factor? I don‚Äôt know, but like, there‚Äôs not *that* big a hight difference. 
Like I said, I think that the art looks fabulous and I honestly like it, but when artists do that, it just seems a little weird to me, like he looks like he‚Äôs dating a frickin 9yo imo, and it just seems off-putting‚Ä¶ anyone else feel this way or have any similar problems like that?",I‚Äôm just curious about something that offputs me a little,2.0,2.0

s5kuxv,"I'm watching Atlanta for the first time and just got to the Season 6 reunion - it's crazy to me how all of these women acted after Porsha attacked Kenya.

Immediately after they rip Porsha off of Kenya, all of the women rush to Porsha's side to comfort her, when she was the aggressor and had literally just attacked someone. Nobody went to Kenya's side or comforted her, and then when they re-joined the Reunion again on set, all of the women blamed the attack on her too. I truly don't understand how they can excuse Kenya being violently attacked.

&#x200B;

I feel the same way about this as I do about the RHOP fight between Monique and Candiace. No matter what someone says, It doesn't excuse putting your hands on somebody else.

Almost every other post I saw there was about how past relationships of women before marriage were dealbreakers for most men. Women were ruthlessly bashed and slut-shamed for pre-marital sex or even simple dating. On the other hand, men that confessed to having paid for sex were let off the hook, and the women that rejected them for that were the regressive ones!!

These men justified their expectation of virginity as 'preference' but a woman looking for someone earning more money was called a gold digger.

Many of us were theorizing this eventuality after ep9, but the majority seemed to assume that Dexter and Harrison were now tight as peas in a pod and that Harrison was 100% totally cool with everything. He wasn't, but he held on because he loved the connection he had with his dad. When he learned that his dad's entire reason for killing was horseshit, like Kurt said it was right before he died, he decides to hold Dexter accountable. Dexter refuses to go with authorities, so he chooses to die instead when he sees what he's done to Harrison. It truly was an act of true love from Dexter's angle. Harrison didn't manipulate the situation like a psychopath, he was ready to leave town before he learned what happened to Logan. It all arrived at a natural conclusion.

I definitely used to use the apps exclusively for hookups and would be upfront about not wanting a relationship and not wanting anything exclusive. They'd act like it was mutual. I'd usually explain that I was moving soon, which was always true, and certainly wouldn't treat them to the boyfriend experience. Wouldn't text unless I wanted to meet up, didn't go on real dates, didn't introduce to my friends, rarely gave compliments, etc., but I think I was still deceptive. I was never ~technically~ in the wrong about being nonexclusive, but in person I'd make things much more emotionally intimate, and that's just who I am. 

I'd usually end things by acknowledging when things got too serious and have never had anyone get pissed at me, though they've clearly been hurt. I legitimately didn't think I was doing anything wrong until I talked to a past fling later on and she told me to be careful about playing with people's feelings. I feel bad about it! But in hindsight, I don't know what I would've done differently except maybe not make them cum so hard.

There are a few movies/TV shows with a lot of sex scenes in them (fifty shades series, euphoria, etc.) that she really enjoys. She loves these movies/shows. 

But in real life she has the lowest libido you can ever imagine, almost always turns me down (when I used to have the courage to actually try to engage), and we never have fun conversations pertaining to sex. She‚Äôs just never been interested whatsoever. 

I guess I just don‚Äôt understand how she can enjoy these movies/shows so much and not become disinterested with the amount of sex scenes that are included. 

Is it immature of me to feel this way? Probably. But I can‚Äôt help it. I guess I feel like a chump.

rwvq5b,"Hello all, so I'm currently finishing up my fourth year of undergrad (at a highly ranked/prestigious school if that matters) and was looking to maybe start applying to medical school this year. However, I'm extremely worried about my application overall. While I'm happy with my MCAT (516), My GPA will be less than stellar despite making the deans honor list several times, as after this semester (assuming I get all A's) I will only have a 3.40 cumulative, and 3.05 science gpa. I developed pretty serious depression during the latter half of my sophomore year that I was only able to pull myself out of this previous summer, ( went from a 3.25 while remote in the spring semester to a 3.6 this previous semester). coupled with lockdown, my father being diagnosed with severe congestive heart failure, and a year and half of remote learning, my grades slipped. I received a C in physics 1 and 2 and a c in OChem 1. on top of that, my home location offered little opportunity for clinical experience- I have only around 20 or so hours of shadowing and will have a few months experience working as a medical scribe (currently training and should start this month) by the time I would submit my application. Is it even worth applying yet, especially if I wanted to get into some of the better med schools around me, like Pitt, OSU, or case western?",Unsure if my med-school resume will be sufficient in time to apply this year-looking for advice,2.0,2.0

rwijfl,"Today in the parking lot under my first floor window I heard some commotion, and looked out to see a woman ranting at a couple of police officers. She was quite eloquent and focussed but from what I got out of it she was very persistently explaining to them that they were aliens and she was Jesus and something about her friend not understanding her. This went on for the best part of an hour. The cops took turns listening to her and making phone calls. Quite calm and collected. I think at some stage an RSPCA van turned up and took a dog away. 

Eventually things calmed down and the cops left. Half an hour later I heard a window breaking and shortly after the cops were back and had the woman in handcuffs. They sat her down in the parking lot right under my window. They fairly calmly explained to her that she was under arrest for damaging property or something like that. There wasn't much commotion. The woman wasn't resisting just continues ranting. She obviously had some sort of mental break and they were taking her to medical care. All fairly reasonable. 

Except for the point where the cop that was explaining all this to her while she is seated against our fence crouches down to talk to her and pulls out a white box, pulls out a cigarette and lights up and smokes it while he is chatting to her right in front of her. At first I thought he was going to offer her one but he didn't make any such motions. Im a smoker so I'm not judging him for smoking but I would imagine that smoking in front of a client would be a huge nono. And the white vogue box implies they were se sort of off market brand. He seemed like a hardass cop that you wouldn't want to mess with.

sdbi0f,"Edit: (M)e 32 now. F 26 now

This begins over a year ago at an old job of mine. A coworker had caught my eye for awhile. Tall for a girl. Brunette. Pretty dark eyes. Had a devious smile, whether she meant to our not. She didn't have big breasts or ass but was toned and shapely.

I noticed she always had hair ties on her wrists. Usually two or three. Sometimes more. Sometimes they were even the big scrunchy ones. But consistently, without a doubt, she always had at least one. 

We always flirted and one day I asked quite innocently (and perhaps from a place of ignorance) why this was. To my surprise she blushed and got really quiet since we were at work with people around. 

""To tie my hair back,"" she whispered before looking down in a bashful fashion. 

I kinda laughed. ""But I never see you with your hair tied back,"" I responded. Once again, I feel like an idiot now but honestly had no clue what she meant.

""For other things,"" she said, in an implicit manner.

I finally got the point and I remember being instantly aroused. 

We had only flirted, but suddenly my plans to turn her into my little slut were expedited (and as I found out later, this is what she was hoping for).

I instantly went very serious and I leaned in very close to her.

""I'd very much like to know what these 'other things' are,"" I told her.

I imagine she was very aroused at this point too and just looked up at me with her big eyes and nodded affirmatively.

Later, I sent her a text and told her to meet me after work and we could go for a drive. She did and we drove to a secluded spot, both knowing what was about to happen.

""Let's see that hair up,"" I told her after I parked. She grabbed a pretty green tie off her wrist and put it up in a ponytail. I gripped it and tugged gently. ""Is this one of those other things?"" I asked.

""Yes,"" was get only response. I saw her eyes dart to my crotch. I was so hard.

Then all I said was ""go ahead"" and her hands went to work unzipping my pants and pulling out my cock. She sucked me off, all while I gripped her pony tail. Slowly I found out she was quite the blowjob expert and could deep throat, without me worrying she was going to make a mess of my pants and car. I leaned back and enjoyed her skills until I started getting bored. Then I gripped her harder and user her warm mouth for a minute or two before cumming. She swallowed it like the good girl she is.

That was the start. We actually went for drinks and then she came back to my condo and we fucked. We were pretty good companions. Both freaks. And we fucked for a few months (not exclusively, but definitely were each other's consistent fucks).

Somewhere in that time, we discussed her hair ties some more.

""But why do you need multiple?"" I remember asking her one time.

""Some guys like pigtails,"" she laughed, but not joking at all. Suddenly, I liked pigtails and shortly afterwards was fucking her face while pulling on her two ponytails.

On another occasion, I gave her a box of like 100 hair ties I think (I honestly don't remember how many exactly). I told her she should give the guys she blows her hair tie afterwards, and see how long it takes to go through the box. 

Shortly afterwards, I got a new job and we slowly stopped meeting up. I got a few of those hair ties from that box but not many.

Fast forward to a couple days ago (over a year later) and I get a text from this girl. I honestly had forgotten all about the hair ties and the box I gave her.

She asked if she could come over for a night and I obliged. When she got here, she barely took two steps in the door, got on her knees, tied her hair back, and aggressively sucked me off. I didn't even touch her. I just let her do her thing and then shot my load in her mouth as she moaned in enjoyment.

She then took the tie off and handed it to me.

**Description**:

""So what do you think about my ferret's new trick?""

This is the question that would remain unanswered for eternity.  The question that ended /u/Clarke2014chris's worst day.  And his days would only continue to be horrendous from then on.  Upon waking on this perfectly-normal morning in his perfectly-normal life...nothing appeared to be amiss.  /u/Clarke2014chris stared into the bathroom mirror with water dripping from his chin.  Washing his face seemed necessary after all the ass he ate the night prior...but was a shower?  He ran his moistened fingers through his hair and decided that would do.  And so he was off to work...5 minutes after his alarm went off.  The winter air chilled his bones to their core.  If only he had paid the extra $3K to get that remote start system in his car last season.  He noticed a black SUV parked beyond his driveway.  The engine was running - as evident by the hot smog escaping the exhaust in the frigid air.  Bam.  The world went black.  A bag over his head and a needle in his arm.  Who knows where...and who knows how much later.  Life slipped back into existence.  He was tied to a wooden chair that had to have been intentionally finished with splinters on every square inch.  The ropes were bristly and uncomfortable.  The metal door in front of him looked as though it hadn't moved in eons.  Rust festered across every inch of it...and yet...before him.  It opened.  And a man with a ferret in his hand entered.

I‚Äôm a 26f and my husband is 29m .
I am 26 weeks pregnant .
Earlier in the week I found my husband on a forum looking at naked girls telling them they‚Äôre perfect , he‚Äôd try to have sex with them if they were his best friend and would be down for one night stands etc . (For context about 3 months ago he told an ex he missed her and wanted her back) . I was extremely upset and I felt like I wasn‚Äôt enough , he isn‚Äôt attracted to my growing body anymore .

s48uy2,"**TL;DR**: My dad is running for a deacon position in my church, but after a few men talked to him after finding my IG, dad said I should delete all photos of me in bathing suits or from gymnastics because they said that it came off as ""inappropriate"" and could hurt him in the vote. They also said that they're ""trying to protect me"", and mom has deleted photos of me from her FaceBook including outfits of her in bathing suits

I was recently able to make it to where I don't have to go every Sunday anymore after a lot of arguing for a long time, but my dad is running for a deacon position and the church is going to have a vote soon. The vote is happening on a weeknight for members where they will vote and announce who won after, and dad said they'll be serving food and having worship while they're counting. That's not for a few weeks though, and dad's been down my throat wanting me to delete my IG. But, I'm making this because other men at church have begun bugging dad about me too after they looked up my page, and I just feel disgusted by the whole thing

I only have Instagram and Snap, but dad told me that some men talked to him and told him that some of the things on my page are ""inappropriate"", and I don't know why they were on my page or how they found it. Dad also pointed to a scripture that says ""you can't be a leader if you can't lead your own children"" when we talked, but I did nothing wrong. Some of the photos have been there for years. But, his friends told him that I should remove some photos where I'm wearing a bathing suit or an outfit from gymnastics because they're inappropriate despite them being there for years. They're just photos from meets or with awards or me training, but dad said that they can be ""taken out of context"" and hurt his chances of getting voted after they mentioned it, and mom has also deleted her bathing suit photos from her FaceBook including photos from my meets. She also said it'd be easier for me to just delete my page and start over with appropriate clothing, and she doesn't want me to just make my old page private either. I just feel weird that these men found my page and don't even know how they did or why they were on it at all. I told this to dad, but he said that they were ""right"" and ""trying to protect me"", and while it's not the end of the world if I end up deleting it... is there anything I can do to make them understand how weirded out I feel that they were looking at it?

&#x200B;

*Edit: Dad said that he and a few of the men had a link to the page, and I'm going to delete it because I'm paranoid of them downloading it or continuing to maybe spread rumors about me which would be how a 'few' of them found out and told dad. So, not for my dad, but because I don't want them to have the link because even if I make it private, it'll show that the page is still up because they have the link, and I could easily just make a new account that's private with a new name that they'd never find. I just don't want to be around those men at church anymore*

*Btw, the photos that the men complained about, were vacation photos that we had someone else take of us and photos from a gallery of a meet that I placed well in years ago, a meet that had a photographer photograph there and give us photos*",Dad wants me(f16) to delete my Instagram because he's running for a position in our church,2.0,2.0

My argument is that there‚Äôs plenty of media telling women they should be independent and live on their own. But not really any media telling men they can do the same. You could argue that there doesn‚Äôt need to be. But men who choose to remain single are still harassed and socially pressured into relationships even if it‚Äôs not as much as women. 

I think men need to build economic success before getting a partner if they do want a partner but there seems to be a lot of men who complain about loneliness when they‚Äôre only a young adult.

sfppgg,"Yeah this was actually last week. I don't know what to do, I just need this off my chest.

It started out as a normal beer with friends, last Friday. We always go to the same pub to start, sometimes stay there all night. It's a cool pub which only plays heavy rock/metal. If you're sick of chart music or pop it's a great spot to hang out and play pool. We got there, I paid for a round of drinks for us and we started out the night smashing Metallica and Sabbath on the jukebox.

The friends I'm with have other friends there who I'm less acquainted with, but I know of their faces and vaguely their names. So as we're drinking and picking songs, a few girls walk over to my pals with the usual ""heyyy how you doing"" etc. The woman I'm talking about is one of these friends, and introduced herself to me. She was nice, tomboyish, quite good looking and I had fun chatting with her. She asked me to put Bruno Mars on in this pub - first red flag. 

A few more drinks into the night, we get bored of the jukebox and head out to the beer garden to smoke and chat some more. I immediately noticed wherever I sat she would pick the seat next to me, and sort of lean in. She would get really close. I thought okay cool she seems interested in me, maybe this could be a good night. I told her I was staying with my buddy and his girlfriend at their place since my car was already there. She's good friends with my buddy's girlfriend, so she blagged staying over there too and we all got a taxi back together.

We got back and continued drinking/partying together. We were all really drunk and the flirting was less awkward at this point. She was cuddling into me on a sofa whilst we all chatted. At some point, around 3am, she pulls her phone out and says ""wonder what the hubby's upto"" and I was like wait... ""What? You have a husband?"" To which she replied ""yeah for 10 years"". 

This was just a stepping stone in the fuck up.

I asked her to come outside and chat about it, saying like wtf are we doing? She explained the relationship had been dying for years, they live separately and it's not even a real relationship anymore. I don't know what I thought about this, but I kept the flirting up as this calmed me a little bit about the situation.

Eventually we end up in bed together and had sex. It was awful, I don't think we were compatible in that regard but I tried my best none the less. I didn't wanna be labelled a shit shag or whatever idk. 

So I wake up the next day pretty early and leave saying thanks for hanging out etc but I gotta get home. I thought ok mistake has been made but we'll just leave it at that, afterall, her marriage isn't going well and will inevitably end.

And here comes the fuck up

She found and message me on Facebook, something along the lines of ""would gladly let you throw me around again xxx"" and I clicked on her profile. My fuckin heart dropped. I instantly recognised the pictures of her husband, and they looked so happy together (at least online they did).

The husband is someone I used to smoke weed with and chill with a lot, through secondhand friends. We had the same dealer and would chill at the dealers house for a couple. This happened weekly for nearly a year or two, but we never really knew each other past that. All I can say about this dude is he is really a great person and I enjoyed his company. Sometimes he would talk about how his wife is being crazy and distant with him and it made him sad. 

I fucked up guys. I need to tell him but I don't want to hurt anyone, but it's beyond that now. I followed my cock and this is where it's landed me. Fml

TL;Dr

I slept with a woman knowing she has a husband. I thought it was a failing marriage, but turns out I used to hang out with the husband and he's a really great guy. I'd never met the wife before this night. Now I don't know what the fuck to do


Edit: ok so everyone seems 50/50 on telling the husband or not, but I'm honestly leaning towards telling. I'll update if I do or don't. I need to plan this 

Also thanks for the wholesome awards.... Lol

I am a married to women man but have played with guys from time to time but not often. I have ventured to a couple of adults bookstores and gotten sucked and sucked a cock or two not many. Well I have need really horny for a cock lately and thought I would  Grinder and Sniffles  but after weeks no luck. So I went to the old fall back bookstore today. Got a private booth, here they are no GH and all booths are half doors so they can check to make sure there is only one person per booth. These rules are a little more relaxed in the private area and did I score. With in a minute I was on my knees with my shirt pulled over my head sucking a nice chubby's cock and playing with his balls. I say maybe 6"" fit my mouth prefect. I could get that nice cock all the way in and I was pulling on my dripping cock, it was great after about 3 or 4 minutes he said he was coming and needed to jack off to finish and he came all over my face and chest. Man it was awesome. He quickly left me there to wipe the cum off my face and then suck my fingers clean and rub the cum of my check and rub it on my cock. So back to watch some bi threesome porn then with in 5 minutes another guy order but in nice shape came to my ajar door with his dick hanging out. I must say it was nice 8"" and thick. I pulled on it for a little bit then started to suck it. I had him sit so I could get on my knees and really have at it. Before we switch places he wrapped his hands around my cock and started to tug on it, man it felt good. The new dropped to his knees and started to give a great blowjob. I always wondered why guys give better BJ than the ladies. After a couple of minutes I tapped him for a switch and I started on the wonderful cock. His was not as easy to get in my mouth. I had to turn my head sideways to get the whole thing in. Yep I was deep throat for the first time and loved filling his cock down my throat. I gagged a couple of time but that did not stop me. I keep at it. I loved hearing him moan in pleasure then he pulled away and c couple of strokes later I was covered in cum again. Unlike the first guy this one let me suck the last drops of cum off his cock, it tasted so good. He thank me and left. I started to JO so more to the porn rubbing all the cum over me. I felt like suck a slut. On other guy came to peek but I guess did not like what I was offering so closed my door and left, then as I was about to cum another way older guy came in with his cock out as I seen the cock I shot my load and was done. I don't know about you guys but once I come I am done. So told him sorry I was leaving and went left. I am at home now getting ready to wash the cum off me before my wife comes home and smells it on me.  It was a good day.",A good day at the adult bookstore,2.0,2.0

Once I had stopped for about 20 minutes, I had feeling return, but it was just intense pain and I was still tied up and very dumb. I was shaking and crying from the pain for the next 2 hours. So, I'm not allowed to touch at all today because if I do, I will end up screaming. The best part fo this is, I went so far into being dumb that I only felt pleasure and nearly destroyed my kitty.

Each of the employees were employed at-will, meaning they were not under an obligation to stay at ThedaCare for a certain amount of time.

After shooting for a bit I pull out the can, mount it on my p226, shoot a mag, wife shoots a mag and then the range worker came in and asked for my tax stamp.   I told him I didn‚Äôt have it with me as it‚Äôs at the bank in my safe deposit box.   He then asked us to leave.   I told him I have a pdf on my phone I can pull up from google drive but he says no, it has to be the original physical form with the stamp, no exception.  He then goes on to explain that they could loose their FFL if an ATF agent came in, though I fail to see the logic there.   The user would be the offender, not the ffl holder.  

I have to say, I wasn‚Äôt mad but I‚Äôm incredibly disappointed.  I never carry a copy of approved form because there is no legal requirement to do so.   The can is legal in every way, as is the sbr.   Why be bootlickers and enforce non existent regulations?

sexxp2,"I am the female half of a late 40s swinger couple. I sometimes say we came at swinging sideways, because initially I was the driving force, and I have a MFM kink. I wanted a fully open marriage and had a totally different approach and mindset. I think I believed that once I said ""Hey, let's not be monogamous anymore"" he would just happily agree to toss it aside and have fun. These past few years have shown me that it just isn't that easy for most people. We ended up with swinging and are actually doing really well in our relationship and sexual adventures. I really feel like we are finally getting on the same page. I have slowed down and he is catching up. I was always the one charging foreword while he hit the brakes. It was very frustrating to say the least. Now he is having lots of fun too. 

So, we just kind of dived right in having orgies and swapping that sort of thing after starting with lots of MFMs as he became more comfortable. Well, we skipped the early steps. The research. Being nervous newbies like deer in headlights. The clubs. I didn't really think we needed all that because we are very sexual people. 

I don't want to go backwards, but I want to be on the same page and work as a team. We got where we are but skipped the fundamentals. So now we have downloaded ""The Ethical Slut"" and are both listening to it. Planning on going to a club and just watch. I have promised to behave myself and not get upset when we don't have sex. 

What were some other steps we may have skipped by diving headfirst into the deep end without learning how to tread water first? I don't know that we really want to mess around with dating apps, we have found plenty of folks other ways and it sounds like they aren't worth the effort, do you think they are necessary?

Hello all. Work has been busy, I hope I haven't kept you waiting too long. I'm aware this chapter isn't quite in straight-chronological order, but this was done by design- I have to cut back a few minutes when I jump to Elias's perspective- and more on that at the end. For now, I hope you enjoy this chapter. \[*Hi kids, do you like violence?*\]

******

&#x200B;

""*You may not have any reason to trust or believe me, but I need your help.‚Äù*

Amilita knew the voice well from studying his propaganda films.

‚ÄúAnd why should I help you?‚Äù The audio tape device continued whirring, and an answer was not forthcoming. Amilita realized it was just a recording, not a live signal.

‚Äú*You may not believe helping me is in your best interests, and will reject my offer out of hand. But consider my deeds so far: I have executed traitors to mankind‚Äôs best interests, spoken nothing but truth in all my broadcasts*, *and have killed a predatory governess who trafficked children, a slaver by any other name. I performed the deed of killing her with my own hands, as would you if she had taken your own son, and then providence gave you the chance to make vengeance where time could never restore what was lost.*‚Äù

Amilita had to admit he was right. Nothing would have stood in her way if anyone had kidnapped her son. She glanced over at the static hologram on her desk. Her son had just turned five, and he was opening presents while surrounded by his sisters. She watched the image change to one of him reaching for a fruit on a vine while riding on her husband‚Äôs shoulders, both of them smiling warmly. But‚Ä¶how had he even known she had a son? Adopting those new communication protocols at the base was looking wiser and wiser, even if they‚Äôd led to the disaster today. The chances of a sympathizer were low, but she‚Äôd seen women do a lot of stupid things to win over a male.

‚Äú*I am not a monster, Lieutenant Colonel Amilita. I am a man of my word. So when I say that I wish these hostages to be returned unharmed, and that I will honor any agreement we come to, you know that I will. I hear that you have tried valiantly to return the lost boys, and for that you have my respect and gratitude, even though you have yet to manage to accomplish finding even a single one. I will accept one returned stolen human child per stolen noble hostage; making this known to the captured noble‚Äôs families may yield unexpected fruit for your investigation into the missing children, which as I understand from the Interior agent, Myrrah, had thus far been utterly unsuccessful.*‚Äù

Amilita‚Äôs heart skipped a beat. That confirmed it. Myrrah *was* alive. She‚Äôd been trained to resist torture, too, yet if Emperor had that information...then she must have had a reason for telling him. It was as green a light as Amilita needed to listen on. *Message received, Myrrah*, she thought to herself.

*‚ÄúI hope that it also makes a sufficient demonstration that my intention in this war is not a material one, as your Governess-General claims. I have enclosed a simple device, one that will receive a signal- eventually, when the time is right. Keep it secure, until the- ‚Äù*

That‚Äôs when her omni-pad rang, causing both her and Lesha to jump. Amilita slammed the lid of the crate shut, and with a harsh *clack* the crackle-hiss of the recording stopped, cutting Emperor off mid-sentence. She looked down at the source of the ringing, stunned. It was her *personal* omni-pad, the one that nobody was supposed to have a direct line to excep-

Lesha cleared her throat, looking embarrassed. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs got a way with words. Very‚Ä¶ suspenseful.‚Äù

Amilita nodded, and couldn‚Äôt help a small smile. The male talked like something out of an old horror movie, and he brought her to the edge of her seat before she‚Äôd even realized it. ‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll have a promising career as a voice actor after he‚Äôs caught and sentenced.‚Äù¬†

Her omnipad rang again, and her smile quickly died. ‚ÄúThank you for bringing this to me, Lieutenant. We‚Äôll conclude this in a bit.‚Äù

‚ÄúMa‚Äôam?‚Äù Lesha seemed surprised to be dismissed.

‚ÄúI need to take this call. It‚Äôs probably about... him,‚Äù she nodded her head toward the black crate on her desk. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt the first time I‚Äôve had to skirt policy in my hunt for him and his operation, Lesha. The more you know about it the more you‚Äôre putting yourself at risk. You understand.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat I understand is that I just took a big risk for you doing exactly that, Lieutenant Colonel. Whatever happens from here on out, I‚Äôm already in it.‚Äù

Amilita heard it ring again, and gave her Lieutenant a single nod. Without another word, she reached into her drawer and pulled the omni-pad out.¬†

‚ÄúAmilita here.‚Äù

It was a very harried-looking Borzun in the frame.

‚ÄúAmilita? Amilita, thank goddess. He‚Äôs here! He‚Äôs *here!*‚Äù

***Totenritt- Death Ride*** 

#((Approximately one hour earlier...))

We were parked in the fire lane in the alley behind the [Deer Park Tavern](https://i.imgur.com/9QIcljW.jpg), the rain drumming steadily on the roof of Larry‚Äôs white work van. The gigantic brick and wood former-hotel was centuries old- Edgar Allen Poe had supposedly slipped down the stairs and cursed the place, and it was nestled firmly in the center of the University of Delaware‚Äôs campus. Lately, the upper floors had been offering ‚Äòspecial‚Äô services to any Shil‚Äô who had the credits to pay.

I had been to Newark on occasion before. I remembered the brick and Georgian Revival architecture, the little local shops. But it seemed in the intervening years, developers, and of course the Shil'vati, had left their mark. I'd recognized the old pizza shop, the student centre, and a few others. But now the bars had second signs written in Shil', the movie theater had advertised 'human movies' and Deer Park had advertised 'men's night Fridays,' with the hour in the small-text having passed, but the sign left out.

Vaughn and some of the men were already inside, dressed in plainclothes and scouting out the situation, while the rest of the cells waited outside in vehicles.

This inaction was killing me, and I couldn‚Äôt get my mind off what Vaughn and I had talked about earlier that evening at Talay.¬†

‚ÄòGray Mask,‚Äô the recruit who had proven himself so eager during Operation Rubicon, gave me a look, but I was too lost in thought to make anything of it. Too focused on the events of earlier in the evening. Too tired.

Tired of all the bullshit, tired of all the lies, and now, I was growing impatient stuck in the back of this van.

It was as if I was caught in a whirlpool, going from a hollow numb sort of nothingness, to intense grief and feelings of loss, to white-hot rage, and back again. I grit my teeth, I drummed my fingers, I looked around the vehicle for something to catch my eye, to distract me, to take my mind toward anything else. It felt like I was going mad.

Every time I tried to get a grip and focus, to pull myself out of this dejected misery, it just dragged me right back over the gaping wound in my mind, *Your parents don‚Äôt love you, and probably never did.* Some part of me howled in pain even as I managed to keep outwardly silent, and I felt the primal need to lash back out, to try and stop this sourceless agony. The irritation prickling me under my skin was building up once more to a white-hot rage, the unstoppable cycle running its course again.

Where was Vaughn? Were we doing this, or not!?

‚ÄúAre they ready yet?!‚Äù I snapped.

Radio jolted off the wheel well he was sitting on, and scrambled to catch his laptop as it slid off his knees. I couldn‚Äôt see his expression under his glossy helmet, but [the LED screen that made up the mask‚Äôs large eye visor continued to display a pair of slowly moving floppy discs, one for each eye](https://i.imgur.com/Q6efjgc.png). I wished he could see my apologetic expression under my mask.

*Sorry*. He didn‚Äôt deserve that. *But some people did*.

Radio tapped away at his laptop for a few moments, before sighing through his vocoder, the machine making his voice sound almost computer-synthesized, ‚ÄúNo confirmation. ‚ÄòOther teams are.. Still green.‚Äù

Gray Mask opened the back doors just a crack, peering out into the rainy alleyway, before closing them and giving a simple ‚ÄúStill clear.‚Äù

I leaned back in my seat, the wheel well opposite Radio, and groaned under my breath. I needed a target. Something I could act on, something I could scream at, something to fight back against.¬†

To say I preferred the rage would be stupid, but it was at least more actionable than any of the other swirling feelings I was hit with since that talk with Vaughn. I couldn‚Äôt tell if wearing my mask was centering me, or opening me up to the emotions in the first place.¬†

You can‚Äôt find a use for sadness, and apathy is close in definition to inaction, but anger and rage *did* things, especially when you had an outlet, and especially when you didn‚Äôt care if you broke the unfortunate recipient. My hands were almost shaking in anger, and I clenched them hard to avoid it, the action causing my gloves to creak with the pressure.

I switched to gripping the hilt of my dagger, the sturdy black aluminum grip felt good in my hand, comforting in the way only a proven-reliable tool of great sentimental value could be.

I heard Radio clear his voice, and shot my head up to look at him.

‚ÄúAll clear. Cameras are down, the manager‚Äôs held at gunpoint in his office and they‚Äôre pulling the tapes. The teams out front are ready. The back door team are parking the truck against the fire exit- done. We‚Äôre set.‚Äù

‚ÄúCommence operation,‚Äù I said stiffly, my sense of relief not making it to my voice.

I could see Gray Mask smile through his ski mask as he brought a large walkie-talkie to his lips, and quietly whispered ‚Äúconfirm confirm confirm confirm‚Äù into it, before giving Radio a light rap with his knuckles over the top of his LED mask, and flashing me a thumb‚Äôs up. Radio took his cue and flipped on the signal disruptor, Larry‚Äôs radio turning to static.

Showtime.

As soon as my boot hit the asphalt, the old inn‚Äôs gigantic front door was being swung open, banging into the wall as my men rushed in. The soft lighting inside beckoned, and the usual din of music had suddenly gone silent.

I stepped up the curb and walked into the building, flanked by Gray Mask with his short handy sawed-off shotgun, and a masked man I didn‚Äôt know the name of from one of the cells, who nodded to me and quickly fell into step with us. [He was wearing a mouthless ski mask](https://i.imgur.com/AZ3KZhk.png) that looked like a cross between a rorschach test and a grouper fish‚Äôs gaping maw, and carrying an AR-15.

They were going to be my guards for the night, since the Twins apparently didn‚Äôt respond and couldn‚Äôt fill their usual role.

Inside was a scene of confusion and terror- and when we stepped into the light, it gave way to horror. The bar had been packed- and now they parted for me, like minnows before a shark.

My boots marched across the old hardwood, heels striking and echoing in the sudden silence as we walked through the ancient entryway [to the more modern bar, a common area](https://i.imgur.com/vLIteYw.png). Masked men had guns trained from almost every angle of the room, covering the patrons who had been gathered in the center, tables pushed over onto the ceramic tile floor. None of the gathered college students, townies, or weekend bikers dared twitch, and for a few seconds, all was quiet.

‚ÄúKneel,‚Äù My nameless guard‚Äôs voice rasped out. The voice was like hardened steel dragged across thick ice, and everyone looked first to him, then over at me.

Scared faces of adults- men and women, stared up at me from their seats. There were even a few Shil‚Äô sat in a corner, gawking, heads on swivels as if expecting at any moment that this would all be revealed as a gigantic prank. That I‚Äôd yank my mask off and the revelries would restart.

Then a man pushed himself to the front of the crowd, drunk and cursing at me through slurred speech. He stopped several feet short as Gray Mask raised his sawed-off shotgun to his shoulder and pointed it at the man‚Äôs head. The drunk eyed it cautiously, as if contemplating what a gun even was for the first time. He slowly put his hands up, crouching down, then stumbled down onto one knee, bowing his head low.

A girl with a denim jacket followed suit, then a fat old man in biker‚Äôs leathers, and then several people at a time, until the room‚Äôs human occupants were all on their knees. A Shil‚Äô stood from the booth and several more guns trained on her, including my needle-toothed guard‚Äôs, and she broke off from her friend‚Äôs attempts to pull her back down onto the bench.

She walked up behind the kneeling humans and stood there, neither of us speaking.

I stepped closer, and scanned her face. This one wasn‚Äôt Borzun- she may have been on the leaner side, but she was tall, with a couple battle scars, and held herself with an absolute air of confidence.

I glanced over her shoulders, her two friends had stood up and cautiously made their way to their leader, allowing me a look at all three. None of them were Borzun.

‚Äú*Where*\-‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not the one we want. She‚Äôs upstairs, with the prostitutes.‚Äù I heard Vaughn call out from the top of the stairs. He wore one of those old stage masks, the *Thalia,* the laughing representation of the Greek Muse of Comedy. Its smiling visage belied the monster beneath. Frankly, it suited him.

Moments after turning to look at him, I heard shuffling, and a man shouting out a warning, followed by a high pitched battle cry.

I‚Äôd stupidly taken my eyes off the Shil‚Äôvati, and I jerked my head back just in time to see her wade her way through the kneeling humans and lunge for me. There wasn‚Äôt time to run, or to think, only to react. I drew my knife from my belt in a single motion, just like Larry had taught me, and instead of trying to run I moved to close the distance. A few steps, much smaller than hers, and I was inside the wide arc of her wild swing.

I jabbed the dagger into her ribs, finding the gap and sinking the knife in several inches. I bounded back, ducking the inside of her powerful forearm as she tried to pinch me against her. She reacted just a hair too slowly, and I was free, the both of us staggering back away from each other, but she was clearly off-balance now. Lurching and holding one hand against her chest, she advanced toward me and swung again, much more cautiously this time.

This time, I was out of tricks, and I made every effort to keep distance from her. Suddenly, there was an ear-splitting boom and burst of light, causing my ears to ring immediately. Without thinking, I had closed my eyes from the flash, and when I opened them again the deceitful Shil‚Äô was on the ground, howling and clutching at the bottom of her leg. Most of her foot was gone, a large splatter of blue blood and sinews taking its place. She began to moan in agony, the fight finally out of her.

Gray Mask swept his shotgun over the crowd- and no one¬†else dared move, even though I knew that was far from a precision instrument, and that he only had one round left in it. There wasn‚Äôt much left of the Shil‚Äôs foot, just a nub of flesh and bone jutting from her heel, spouting blue blood on the floor into an increasingly growing pool.

I gave him a quick nod of thanks, and he just tilted his shotgun slightly in acknowledgment.

I looked over to Vaughn, his Thalia mask still smiling down at us, its mirthful face almost laughing at the bloody scene as he came down the stairs, two at a time. From the neck down, he looked for all the world like an off-the-clock Best Buy employee with his bright blue polo and khakis, just here for the cheap wings.

I looked down at the Shil‚Äô, the fight had clearly gone out of her, and now she was on the floor rolling back and forth, both hands clutching at her ankle.

I saw a human man trying to wrap something around her ankle- a make-shift tourniquet using a Shil‚Äôvati flag that one of my men had torn down from the bar, and it made my blood *boil*.

This man was helping the *enemy*, an *invader*, one of the very women who stole our planet from us, killing millions in the process. A woman who looked at him and every other human male as either a prostitute- a whore that would degrade and debase himself for alien money, or worse, utterly useless. To her, the galaxy revolved around Shil‚Äô, and everywhere else lived to serve it.

This woman would obliterate our culture, the very things that make us human, the second her superiors told her to, and she wouldn‚Äôt bat an eye- and this man was *helping* her.

I couldn‚Äôt help but scream at him ‚ÄúWe're here fighting for *you*, and what do you do? You go and try to heal your old master, because what, you think she'll still be able to take care of you? You're a whore to her, nothing more. You're a whore. Stop acting like she'll do anything other than use you to her own ends! Stop acting like she sees you like a person!‚Äù

The weak were made to be weak through dependency, through leaning on others to do the work for them. Independence was strength. Independence was why people followed me. I needed humanity to be strong and that meant taking away what was keeping the man in front of me weak.

Fuck everything I‚Äôd been raised with. There was one real truth in life. I might not be able to trust anything I‚Äôd been raised to believe, but this one was obvious, and inescapable, immune to all the lies everyone told me, the strong prevailed, and the weak perished.

My jaw set hard behind my mask, I glanced at Vaughn, then gestured at the moaning Shil‚Äôvati woman with my knife, blue flecks impacting the ground near where I pointed. He strode forward, his little black pistol in hand. A diminutive low-caliber thing meant for old ladies and the infirm, Larry had said of it. Yet it looked more than deadly in Vaughn‚Äôs hand, as he stepped closer and closer to the wounded Shil‚Äô. The empty smiling face of his mask bore down on her like a predator on the savannah his focus was completely zeroed in on her. She must have realized what was coming, because she screamed a split second before the distinctive ‚Äòpop‚Äô of Vaughn‚Äôs pistol silenced her.

Her corpse hit the ground, almost trapping the good samaritan‚Äôs arm underneath her leg, and her friends screamed out. One look from my mask, and a generous sweeping motion from my unnamed guard with his rifle, and they were silent. I turned my gaze on the humans in the room.

‚ÄúThe prostitution here ends today,‚Äù I ground the words out in English, some of the faces looking up to me. ‚ÄúYou are better than that. The gifts they bring, the safety they promise, the wealth they carry, what is it really worth? With a word, I could have you all killed, and neither the Shil', nor anyone else, can stop me.‚Äù

Many of them exchanged glances, a few scattered whispers- and slowly, some of them looked back at the two remaining Shil‚Äô, the only ones in this room besides myself and my men who were still standing.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre human-‚Äù one started to say, before Vaughn strode forward to kick her onto her back, I suspected the heavy steel toed boot did much of the work for him.

‚ÄúSo are many of the collaborators we‚Äôve killed. Do you want to be one of them?‚Äù I asked, gritting my teeth.

The sight of these people sickened me. All the help and loving parents and support in the world, and this is all they managed to amount themselves to. They were *weak*. Replace one power with another, and they‚Äôd kneel to it just as quickly.

The two remaining Shil‚Äô, for their part, looked horrified. The shorter one was staring down at her friend‚Äôs corpse, and the taller, more muscular of the two was slowly backing up, her hands hovering open-palmed near her jaw, somewhere between a defensive stance and the universal sign for ‚Äòsurrender‚Äô. She must have seen my mask turn toward her, because she froze mid-step, and locked her gaze on me. Her expression darkened by the second, and for a moment all I could hear was the ringing in my ears and the sound of her increasingly hurried breathing.

The shorter one suddenly spoke, *‚ÄúPlease, I‚Äôm just here to drink, I‚Äôve never even touched a human in my lif-‚Äù*

That‚Äôs when the taller one turned in a burst of explosive movement, sprinting past the nearby bar and toward the fire exit. There was an accompanying twitch of movement from my guard in the grouperfish mask, following, matching, and then overtaking the Shil‚Äôs desperate movement with the front sight of his rifle like a duck hunter drawing a bead on his quarry.

Then, all at once, there was another eruption of flash and noise as he fired, the modified AR sending a quick burst of fire into the fleeing alien woman, and showering me with hot spent brass in the process. In the time between her strides, her back turned into a mess of small holes and blue gore, with a few misses making tiny pin pricks in the wood paneling behind her. She hit the ground just feet from the door, unmoving. Some of the bar-goers screamed, but most had the good sense to hug the floor and stay quiet.

‚ÄúDead before she hit the ground.‚Äù Grouper said, scanning across the humans, and then focusing on the last remaining Shil‚Äô.

For a few seconds, I felt stunned myself. A momentary reprieve from these roiling emotions, before shaking myself out of it and turning back to the smaller, shorter Shil‚Äô.

She had ducked when the shooting started, I assumed, because she was on her knees now, looking at her second dead friend in as many minutes with horror. Shocked, that any of this was happening at all.

‚ÄúHey asshole! That‚Äôs my truck parked on the other side of that fuckin‚Äô door!‚Äù one of the masked men yelled from across the bar in a deep Maryland accent, and finally the remaining Shil‚Äô stirred.

Her eyes glanced over at the large windows, then she turned her head back over at the room full of gunmen, watching, waiting, all of them almost daring her to give running a try.

At last, her eyes locked onto my mask, and she started to beg.

‚ÄúPlease-‚Äù

‚ÄúPlease *what*?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt kill me. Take me hostage, you do that, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù

I thought about it for a moment. We now had three empty cells. We *could* have taken all three alive, if I‚Äôd ordered it. If I‚Äôd *wanted* to. I glanced at the two dead Shil‚Äô. Perhaps I‚Äôd made a mistake.

But what was I here to *do* tonight? I‚Äôd just let some of the prizes of this mission fall right through my fingers. Yes, this had all been hurriedly planned, and yes there was no guarantee there *would* be any reward, depending on the response I got. Yes, it was a miracle that Vaughn had managed to assemble so many people on such short notice, and that the bar had been taken over so smoothly. But beyond that, from the moment I‚Äôd walked into the door the execution, both literally and figuratively, had been sloppy.

The blame rested at my feet as surely as the two corpses.

‚Äú*P-Please don‚Äôt kill me*!‚Äù she pleaded to me, bending forward and futilely trying to protect the back of her head with her hands, as if it could ward off the bullet. ‚ÄúI surrender!‚Äù

At my lack of response, she seemed to cave in. The Shil‚Äôvati woman knelt further, adjusting her legs and bowing her head to me, both hands on one knee. Then, slowly, she parted her hands to deepen her kneeling. An almost ritualistic show of servile deference. I hadn‚Äôt seen a Shil‚Äô do this- not ever. But I was sure it had significance. I held up my hand as one of my men stepped behind her, raising his revolver to the back of her head.¬†

‚Äú*E-Emperor, I se-*‚Äù

‚Äú*Stop*.‚Äù I commanded her harshly, and she cut herself off with a peep. I knelt down to her dead friend, fishing through her pockets until I found it, an omni-pad. It was much newer than anything I‚Äôd seen humans use, but I could tell it was cheap by Shil‚Äô standards. I wiped the bloodied corner off on one of the dead woman‚Äôs clean pant legs, and quickly navigated to the translator. I thought for a moment as I did it that I was lucky I had time to look over Natalie‚Äôs gift earlier that day, before shutting the thought down completely. This wasn‚Äôt a place to think about her.

I set the machine to translate Shil‚Äô to English, and dropped it unceremoniously on the corpse, looking back at the Shil‚Äô. The woman continued to stare down at the floor, her hands still in their deferential pose, just barely starting to shake.

‚Äú*Continue*.‚Äù I said in Shil‚Äô, the omni-pad translating immediately, and just loud enough for everyone in the silent bar room to hear it.

‚Äú*I*\-‚Äù she paused as the program played out a rough approximation of her voice, and finally glanced up at me, as if reconsidering what she was doing. A second of staring at my mask, and the knife in my hand still fresh with blue blood, was enough to make her decision. She quickly looked back down, and continued.

‚Äú*Emperor, I submit to you and your rule, and recognize you as Emperor of House Mankind, Ruler of Earth, bestowed by- yourself.*‚Äù

*Well that was a surprise.* How did she know what I had called myself? It must have been Masarie. She had overheard my desperately-made house vow to save Hex from Myrrah, offering one life for another, and claiming that I represented all Mankind. Apparently the news had spread.

I looked to my left, at Grouper I could only see his eyes through his mask, but it was enough to tell that he was just as uncertain about what to make of that as I was.

I looked back at the beseeching Shil‚Äô, my insurgency field manuals never covered this sort of thing, so I had to improvise.

*‚Äú*State your name.*‚Äù*

*‚ÄúZ-Zay'ada.‚Äù*

‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt partake in... male services, did you, Zay'ada?‚Äù I asked, patiently.

‚Äú*I- in- Oh! In that? No, I did not! Please, don‚Äôt kill me. I swear, I didn‚Äôt*.‚Äù Her desperation would be evident even without the translator, and it made me second guess her words; desperation spawned lies.

I glanced around the room, searching for disagreement, searching for *guilt*. ‚ÄúIs she telling the truth? Did anyone here *sell themselves* to her?‚Äù I asked, switching to English. No one raised a hand to suggest this was anything but the truth.

What to do, then? Take *another* hostage? A single hostage was worth a lot of money, but then, we already had so many; once you cracked a few billion, what was one more? True, we had the cells and the space, but each and every time we took one to the base on Warehouse Row, we ran the risk of discovery, of being followed back. No, there could be more from her.

‚ÄúMy terms for your life are simple. Leave this planet before sunrise. Never return to Earth. Never lay a finger on any human. If you see one in danger off Earth, render them aid.‚Äù

There, that was better. When I answered, she finally raised her head.

*‚ÄúAs- as you command, rightful Emperor of Mankind, but- you must know, I‚Äôll be put to death for acknowledging your sovereign dominion over Mankind. Please, I beg you, reconsider your orders. Let me join you, or- or-*‚Äù

Now I was angry. I‚Äôd given her something- and what, she imagined she‚Äôd slip in with the working class as a hidden rebel? That we‚Äôd give her a rifle and trust this weakling who buckled, to open fire on her one-time comrades?

‚ÄúYou should have fought, then. Even against overwhelming odds. Even when the weight of the galaxy leans against a single planet. You should have fought! You should fight!‚Äù I waved a hand over at the watching humans.

Instead of rising, she started to cry, and I turned on my heel. I couldn‚Äôt stand the sight of it. ‚ÄúBefore sunrise, Zay‚Äôada, or we‚Äôll find you just as easily as we found Ministriva.‚Äù

I walked toward the stairs, climbing past the vacated second floor, up to the third floor.

Fairy lights had been crudely strung over the wooden railing, and photos of long-dead men gazed out at me from the staircase‚Äôs walls as the creaky old stairs took my weight. Prominent locals, heroes, the people that built this town, gathered around fountains or in front of an old factory. These were the pillars of local society. I held a bitterness knowing I‚Äôd been lied to. Lied to by all of society, that there was never a chance that any of them, or anyone else, would have accepted me as Elias. That had I kept going, being a ‚Äògood boy‚Äô at school, even at Talay, none of this would have happened. They just would have continued bullying and beating me down. Only by being Emperor had I found acceptance, friends, and most of all, *power*.

More of my men stood at the top, keeping an eye on the stairs with pistols drawn. I saw the manager knelt between them at the end of the hallway, hands on top of his balding head, held at gunpoint and weeping quietly.

‚ÄúBorzun?‚Äù I asked, simply. ‚ÄúThe‚Ä¶ frail one.‚Äù

It annoyed me that I even needed to bother to talk to yet another Shil‚Äô collaborator.

The balding man, combover askew and fat belly spilling over his beltline, tie torn from his collar and held like a noose above his head with a boot pressing square on his back, seemed to be torn between begging for mercy, and offering me a bribe. I almost wanted him to try. Offers of cash, favors, women even, as if I were some Shil‚Äôvati bureaucrat or human toadie that set a price on his own integrity, and had stumbled over his little operation.

‚ÄúT-Third door, on the right.‚Äù

I wanted an outlet for all this anger. He looked like a nice, soft target that had been sitting and counting dollar bills while my followers and I had been out there, risking our lives to save the planet from the very people lining his pockets, growing stronger all the while. Had he thought that his little venture would last forever, that he could just wait us out, weather the turmoil we had spread like a storm, and that nothing would happen?

‚ÄúVendetta.‚Äù He turned to me, and I gave my masked friend the nod.

‚ÄúHow?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve earned the right to a little creative freedom.‚Äù

I turned on my heel and marched down the hall, finding the door. A little plaque was affixed overhead, made of thin, purple metal. it read ‚Äò*Captain‚Äôs Suite‚Äô*, in Shil‚Äô. I glared at it, before quickly grabbing it with my gloved hand and yanking it off the wall, taking a thin strip of wood paneling with it, and throwing it down the old wooden staircase.

My body had broken out in a sweat from the heat on this floor, even though I was well acclimated to the summer‚Äôs highs.

I found myself pausing before the polished wood door and, because something ingrained deeply within me demanded it- I knocked, then tightened my grip on the knife in rage.

I had the power of life and death over anyone in this building. I could muster a strike force with a few words and a phone call. I was the most wanted man on the planet, and yet I was *still* under the influence of my mother as her son.

I waved my knife back and forth across the air in front of me, as if cutting the strings from an invisible puppeteer's hand, and I felt their guiding pull slacken, the strain against what I was about to do fading away. Mother would be horrified if she knew what I was doing now. Something about that gave me a perverse sort of pleasure.

‚Äú*Mmm? Come in.‚Äù*

I twisted the black iron doorknob and the door swung open without so much as a creak.

She was naked and on her belly, blissfully unaware of the going-ons downstairs, face down on a massage table. She was slender, as Shil‚Äô went, and wasn‚Äôt wearing a stitch on her lean body, completely devoid of scars unlike many of the other Shil‚Äô I‚Äôd seen. Her hands were down at her sides.

I couldn‚Äôt fault her for not hearing all the commotion or noticing the sudden quiet; the old inn was right next to a railroad, and the thick walls and ancient soundproofing had done their jobs well.

The room itself was an eclectic mix of college dorm movie posters and a few old tables holding an arrangement of incense, lotions, and even candles. Rags were folded and stacked neatly in the corner atop a dresser, next to a conspicuously placed bed. The oversized, purpose-built massage table she lay on couldn‚Äôt have been easy to get up the narrow stairwell, but the room itself was certainly spacious enough.¬†

The old windows, hand-spun glass from centuries ago with all their strange imperfections were being illuminated by the Deer Park Tavern‚Äôs signage from below, and drew strange colorful patterns on the ceiling. It reminded me of home.

*Home*. It implied a place where one was to find love. To lay one‚Äôs head to rest. To belong. What right did *she* have, or any of them have to feel at home anywhere on my planet, in any of those senses of the word?

My two guards had shadowed me inside, and the odd, heavy footfalls, or perhaps the lingering smell of burnt gunpowder, must have alerted her that something was amiss, because she pushed herself up, only to startle at the sight of me.

‚Äú*Data Officer Borzun.‚Äù* I said. *‚ÄúI hear you‚Äôve been looking for me.‚Äù*

Looking for me. To have me dragged from my bed in the middle of the night, and then to have me killed, like they‚Äôd killed Scott. Like how she would do to everyone in my resistance, if only she could. But *here*, she was weak, and within my grasp.

She quickly sat upright, and squeaked out, *‚ÄúOh Goddess, you‚Äôre real!‚Äù* mouth agape and eyes wide. She blinked a few times, and said *‚ÄúI mean, I know you‚Äôre real- but, you‚Äôre him?‚Äù* her eyes roamed between my guard‚Äôs weapons and myself. *‚ÄúIs this really happening?‚Äù* she asked. I just gave her a nod. *‚ÄúYou‚Äôre- you‚Äôre Emperor.‚Äù*

‚Äú*I am who you think I am.‚Äù*

*Emperor. I, am Emperor.*¬†

I felt betrayed by my upbringing as Elias. Betrayed. I hadn‚Äôt been set up to succeed, I‚Äôd been set up to fail! They‚Äôd failed me! Everything I had believed in had been lies!

I‚Äôd been twisted, tortured, and the rest of human society had used me, manipulated me for their own purposes of entertainment. To everyone else, I‚Äôd been made a punching bag- whether physical, or verbal, or the butt of bullying. And all for what, for this? This depravity? For them to sell themselves out and still think themselves above me?

‚Äú*Put your clothes on! Or don‚Äôt, and die the way you were born- naked, bloody, and screaming!‚Äù*

She froze up and stared at me with those wide golden orbs, quaking in place, arm in front of her chest not out of modesty but fear, to try and ward me off as I clutched the dagger, pointing the tip at her.

Let it all burn down and collapse inward. This old inn, our society, all the monuments to all the people just like those who had lied to me. I‚Äôd bask in the warmth of it all. I‚Äôd catch the ashes on my tongue like snowflakes and dance before the flames!

But then, could I afford that luxury? No, of course not! Just like so much else in life, I‚Äôd never be able to just *enjoy* something. Always on the move. I‚Äôd have to carve out every bit of satisfaction I got in life.

Vaughn was right. Nothing was worth living for, but some things were absolutely worth killing.

Purple was the color from mixing red and blue. It was the color of Emperors. Spilling the blood of both, right now? Roman Emperors changed their names when they donned the purple; nothing could have felt more appropriate to me that mine be a baptism in the blood of my enemies; a rebirth of sorts.

Even as I adjusted my grip on the knife and tried to rationalize myself into setting the events into motion, I knew something *else* was wrong. Something was holding me back from jumping in with both feet and plunging the knife in my hands into her naked flesh.

The only sound in the room was my breathing, echoing out of the vocoder a fraction of a second after every breath.

I‚Äôd cut the strings- but left the work half-done. I still wasn‚Äôt free, and I wouldn‚Äôt be, not until I was free of *him*.

There was still some part of Elias inside me. That weak, pathetic coward. Unwanted since birth, and now even I didn‚Äôt want anything to do with him. He was afraid, as always. Always cowardly. Always fearful. Now, I could be rid of him for good, wear his skin as a suit only when absolutely necessary, and then one day, ditch it in the trash where it belonged.

Elias was so pathetic, someone could put a candle to his skin and he‚Äôd rationalize about how it was for his own good before he‚Äôd ever even think to fight back. He *needed* to die, too.

All I had to do was take my dagger, and carve him out. Then I would be free to do as I pleased.

After that, I would be Emperor, and no one else!

And yet‚Ä¶ yet there was something I was missing. Something critical.

So what if they‚Äôd lied? So what if I‚Äôd been wrong? It didn‚Äôt matter. In a way, I‚Äôd forged myself into who I was now *in spite of my lack of upbringing from my parents*. Without the books, then who would I be? Who would I be, without those who poured their wisdom and morals into text for me to cling to, to better myself with.

Did I hate *myself*?

These questions- they rankled me.

I looked inward, at that scared boy, still cowering in fear from me. From Emperor. From myself.

No matter what I did, I could never get my parents, sibling, or even my classmates to love me. The world had *hated* me.

More questions followed on. Unrhetorical, but I couldn‚Äôt answer them, either.

Wasn‚Äôt it enough that *they* hated me?

I felt something drain out of me. Not just a singular facet, but everything. I felt parts of my body relax that hadn‚Äôt been untensed since before my talk with Vaughn at Talay. So much so that I almost let my dagger slip from my fingers.

Why did I have to join them?

Why was I doing their work for them?

No.

No, this was all wrong.

If I had made myself, then I could make myself *more*. More than them. More than any of them had ever been to me. Be better than them, to spite them. Throw it back into their faces. They‚Äôd tried to crush me down, and they‚Äôd *lost*.

*‚ÄúRise.‚Äù*

She whimpered, seemingly too struck with fear to even move.

I put my arm forward, knife still wielded in the other, and offered Borzun my hand.

I knew that before me, on her shaking knees was an alien. An alien who had collaborated with a corrupted and servile human government, to try and have me found, and killed. Who had found and led to the deaths of people like Scott, and countless others who had spines enough to stand up and fight back against the slow, tireless, exsanguination of our culture, of our government, and to secure our rights to exist and determine our own futures. But in my mind‚Äôs eye, I saw a vision of myself, or rather, how I imagined my alter-ego. An emaciated, neglected, pathetic blond boy with toes pointed inward, arms crossed in a futile warding gesture against threats beyond his ability to control. Looking up at me, as if I was about to strike him.

More than anything they‚Äôd ever done for me; I could show myself mercy.

I sheathed the knife, and offered her a towel, trying pointedly to not think about how it had been used in the past.‚Äù

*‚ÄúI have something to tell you.‚Äù*

s3s7qt,"I've struggled to find a concrete answer to this, as reading in Russian still gives me a lot of difficulty, and I didn't find any articles written specifically about this subject. I searched my university's archive and Google Scholar, but found no papers on this phenomenon either.

From YouTube channels to more legally dubious online sources, I can count around two dozen active or intermittently active unofficial voice-over dubbing groups (–∫–æ–º–º–∞–Ω–¥—ã –æ–∑–≤—É—á–∫–∏). There's a large range of specialisations (some are dedicated entirely to dubbing anime, some dub films and TV shows, YouTube channels typically dub web-series or independent short films, videogame dubs, etc.) and production quality (single actor for all dialogue, one VA for male and one for female voices, sometimes even entire teams of around 5 VAs with high quality closed captions and subtitles), but their sheer amount is what really gets me.

The community seems to be super established and widespread. Many of these groups have their own websites or VK pages where they post updates on their work, they receive donations through VK or DonationAlert, there's even a ""dubbing wiki"" which tries to catalogue and keep track of all these groups, noting which ones are active and which ones have disbanded.

Some teams are so quick on the uptake that when a film or TV show comes out, I think to myself ""I give it 2 days and there'll be a Russian VO dub of this"". For the fun of it, I once searched for Russian dubs of an obscure film I enjoy and was amazed to discover 5 different ones. Later, I looked into a 13-episode anime series and found it had been dubbed in its entirety by 9 separate groups.

And my question in all of this is ""why""? Why Russia, why dubbing? I understand that the Russian language is a very popular and widespread, but so is French, Spanish and Hindi, yet those don't have an entire cottage industry of voice-over groups (there are some Hindi and Spanish fandubs, but they're rare, one-off instances).

**My theories have been as follows:**  
\- Less strict enforcement of copyright law? This would explain how so many of these groups continue existing despite sharing copyrighted material like films and TV shows.  
\- A large, unmet demand, maybe? If there's a large demand for dubbed media, yet very few official sources providing this service, it would explain how these unofficial groups came to prominence (if this was the case, it begs the question: ""why is the demand so high?"").  
\- Maybe official Russian translations and dubs are of poor quality, and people actually prefer these unofficial dubs?  
\- Voice-acting and translation is (for whatever reason) an unusually popular occupation in Russia, and these teams do this to supplement their income and practice while they look for work in real dubbing studios? Maybe students doing stuff for their portfolio? (This doesn't explain the groups which have been active for years)  
\- This largely donation-fuelled work actually pays well enough for people to do it full-time and have a stable source of income?

s3zgm3,"Hi everyone

So I get this might be controversial but what do you people really think of Steve? I read comments saying that he was/is perfect for Miranda but really? I think he was a big loser and she was always too good for him!
That episode where he wants to have sex with her early morning which invariably leads Miranda to be late for work, really riled me up. When she gets pissed at him at night for not wanting to do it every morning, he turns the tables on her. Like it's her fault she won't budge. Why should she have to change her life and routine? Why is it always the woman? What was Steve doing? 
Then the one where he wanted to move in after just a few months of dating because she had the better apartment and it would suit him just fine.

It is a statement that conforms to the *very* antiworker idea that poor people have an obligation to abstain from luxuries entirety. It is shaming someone using food stamps because they have an iPhone, or shaming a parent who takes their kid to work because they can't afford childcare.


The mission of r/antiwork is to advocate for all people who are being deprived a *decent* standard of living. That means more than just affording to survive. It means affording the luxuries that make a life *decently good.* It means fighting *for* the person who relies on tips, *for* the person who can't afford to tip, and *against* the person forcing struggling people to fight over breadcrumbs.

Colin Farrell, for me, played a crucial part in this because of the character he was written. He was my favourite.

Secondly, Hugh Grant. It was interesting to see Hugh play this part as normally he plays a typical English toff. He done extremely well I found. 

All involved done a brilliant job and it‚Äôs rare I enjoy a movie this much. I‚Äôve watched numerous times and this production has me yearning for Guy Ritchie‚Äôs next project.

Ultimately the writers deserve most of the credit and with the director for me it‚Äôs just pure entertainment. The way the characters converse just makes me chuckle. So gentlemanly while conducting obscene acts. Really clever.

sfhtoh,"Im so sick of this delusion that PC players have this god like advantage over (YOUR $999 CONSOLE) 

I‚Äôm watching some random guys stream and the discussion of aim assist comes up .. before I go any further I‚Äôm hybrid .. that‚Äôs when I came to the conclusion that console players are the whiniest brats on the planet ..LITERALLY.. 



It‚Äôs not me it‚Äôs his mouse and keyboard: 

This ‚Ä¶ this statement alone sends me to a place no man should go .. it‚Äôs makes me want to snatch every fiber of hair on my head legs and arms right off .. If I could I would personally pay money to purchase any controller player a brand spanking new mouse and keyboard.. give them a full 365 days on it and happily Smash them in the face with a humble pie when they decide to give up 3 hours in ‚Ä¶ 




120 fov is the game changer:

I guess I can speak for everybody who has crossed this bridge ‚Ä¶ we all thought this ‚Ä¶ and in a way it is‚Ä¶ but not nearly as much as 80 fov joe thinks it is .. one day you make the glorious jump from airplane room ‚Ä¶ to quiet air conditioned office vibe ‚Ä¶ you load up warzone and check your new slider .. behold ‚Ä¶ fov.. you jack that bad boy up to 120 hop in a game and holy hell I can‚Äôt see shit! ‚Ä¢_‚Ä¢‚Ä¶ and that‚Äôs your experience for the next 8 to 9 months .. not to mention learning how to take 150 meter gun fights at 120 fov will make you consider just playing on 80 fov again ‚Ä¶ 





PC players and there 200 FPS computers: 

Yes ‚Ä¶ some guy really said that ‚Ä¶ comical right ? No ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs pure delusion.. 20- ..  200 what ? FPS ? Where ? On what game ‚Ä¶ warzone ? No way you believe that ‚Ä¶ i firmly  believe that warzone is the worst optimized triple A title on the market and it‚Äôs not even funny ‚Ä¶ I7 processor 3060 gpu and 32 gb in my rig and I barely scrape 100 ‚Ä¶ now yes .. 100 frames is more then 60 .. this is a marginal advantage at the most ‚Ä¶.but if you think frames will make you better you are sadly mistaking ‚Ä¶ and this also takes some getting used to ‚Ä¶ more frames means you appear to move slower to your mind ‚Ä¶. So if you think you jumping from 60 to ‚Äú 200 FPS ‚Äú is gonna be fun to you I gotta little secret for you it‚Äôs not‚Ä¶. More then likely that guy that killed you on pc isn‚Äôt pulling more then 144 frames and that‚Äôs pushing it ‚Ä¶. 





Well ‚Ä¶. Well ‚Ä¶.. ALL PC PLAYERS DO IS CHEAT!: 

I‚Äôm sooo sick of the leather recliner ‚Ä¶ legs kicked up ‚Ä¶ kids bouncing all around the living room ‚Ä¶ wife talking about her long day at the office ‚Ä¶ 90 inch plasma screen tv plastered on the wall 15 yards across the room ‚Ä¶ 40 dollar turtle beach headset at work ‚Ä¶ yeah‚Ä¶. you know the guy ‚Ä¶ ( hey green how many are on yo‚Äî ERNT‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ ‚Äú wait wtf let me see this guys kill cam ‚Ä¶. yep he‚Äôs cheating guys gun is barely moving ‚Äú give me a break ‚Ä¶. 


Well this has been my rant ‚Ä¶.now look pc has its advantages ‚Ä¶ but if you think that‚Äôs the wall between you being the thumbless bot that you are ‚Ä¶. Or being good ‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre kidding yourself .",Yes .. I‚Äôm talking about you ..,2.0,2.0

I hesitate to bring it up given the praise this show gets on Reddit, but maybe /r/television will be a little less hype than the main sub.

We‚Äôre spending more time with Marco, his kid, and this reporter than we are the main cast‚Ä¶ or at least it feels that way.

Idk, people are talking about the final three books tying up more so hopefully we eventually get a film or two.

I told him I wasn't happy with him using it as his second bedroom but he didn't care. He thinks putting his sofa and TV in it makes it his room. The rest of us never get a chance to have it to ourselves and if we use it it involves sitting while he watches what he wants to watch, so we no longer want to go in there.

I've been keeping my mouth shut since then but I just went down and he's rearranging it to make room for his new, bigger TV, and I'm fuming. He never leaves the house as it is and he's in there 24/7. I said I wanted to swap my room with the living room as I don't think it's fair to pay the same when he's taking over the entire downstairs for the same amount of money. He's not listening.

What i can do as well is let you guys know of any news i get earlier than most, for example, my guest this week is ben ikin, i recorded the episode last wednesday and he revealed that the broncos had signed Te Marie Martin and he was coming of of retirement. a couple days later that was reported everywhere as official. im fairly new to reddit but have chatted with the Modz because i want to add to the group, and i feel like this can be a positive thing because like i said these podcasts are more for the die hard fan rather than the ""bloke in a bar"" and stuff like that. not saying theyre bad at all, its just a different type that i dont think there is much of out there. like i said too id love any feedback you have its something im putting more and more effort into and its loads of fun. it‚Äôs available on apple podcasts and Spotify, ENJOY

s3ttlm,"Apologies in advance if this has been discussed!  

Yesterday someone helpfully pointed out to me that one of Adam's tattoos is a rabbit and that got me thinking about the rabbit imagery that was a bit more prevalent early on, but seems potentially meaningful.  Here goes, I'll make it quick:

One of the first things we see from Shauna is her killing, butchering and eating a rabbit from the garden - and she's kind of hostile about these garden rabbits.  Callie mentions Shauna's rabbit collection; Shauna says she hates rabbits (iirc).

We later learn that Jackie loved rabbits, and that Jackie's parents have been regularly gifting rabbit figurines to Shauna - hence her collection.

I had forgotten this, but a rabbit headed character figures somewhat prominently in the pilot scenes of the ritual feast.  

And then we have Adam's tattoo.

Very definitely probably overthinking this (it's only Friday, lol!), but, does the rabbit represent Jackie?  Do we think Jackie is wearing the rabbit get-up?  Is Shauna?  Is Adam Jackie's son?  (This is currently my favorite theory, but I look forward to learning more from the show.)  Have we ever seen the teens eat a rabbit in the wilderness?

Just having fun and exploring some of the storytelling, and I'm curious if anyone else has rabbit issues.","Rabbits, Jackie and Shauna",2.0,2.0

She is honestly a master manipulator because she managed to make her repeatedly flashing David who was only 21 at the time (& his friends) into a sob story about how they overstepped her boundaries and Ethan never called her out for it. It was as if getting naked without others consenting because of a mean joke David made was an acceptable reaction? I remember in the vlog Natalie was on the couch and she looked so uncomfortable and Jason had to cover Trisha to stop her from exposing everyone. Somehow she was the victim of that story. Imagine David flashed everyone his dick because he was mad at something. He would go down as a predator (rightly so).

Also remember on the frenemies ep where they interview Jeff and he even spoke about how his first time meeting her she flashed her tits at him and he was uncomfortable about it and she manages to still make him the one in the wrong. Not to mention her ripping him apart for leaving Starbucks because he saw her, the woman who flashed him and also drove her car into his best-friends house. But he's the weird one for avoiding her??

She also flashed everyone on Kian & JCs reality house s1, like the whole room. She flashed her vagina to them without asking them because of a comment someone said about her having diamonds on her vagina. Everyone was shocked but again she managed to make it seem quirky.

I just can't believe that for so long she spoke about how creepy influencers are and she spoke over and over about the vlog squad being creeps but her history is out there on film and was never brought up. She's so lucky none of the vlog squad ever came out with the truth.",Trisha Flashing,2.0,2.0

For those who aren't aware, Blue Colony is a codebase that saves your bank account, owned properties (and items inside it), and criminal record between rounds. It's pretty cool, but the server that runs it has a strict HRP ruleset, which isn't something I enjoy in the slightest.

Instead of complaining about it on the Blue Colony discord, we just went and made our own server. It has **fairly loose rules - only a short handful preventing racial slurs, and ERP -** and gives a lot of freedom to the player government to make their own laws.

**It's up on Thursdays, Fridays, and Sundays**, and at the moment we get about 15\~ concurrent players at peak times.

sc2h94,"CNBC just used 30 minutes of time that was scheduled to be part of a normal hour of Shark Tank, something I sit down to watch in my hotel room every day when I get back from work, so I personally know this schedule well. 

Every day at 5 PM Pacific the news on CNBC ends and Shark Tank begins. This Monday was no different, except the stock market saw the NASDAQ take a 4%+ drop and DOW take a 3%+ drop only to recover, and like another post on this sub pointed out, that‚Äôs the most significant drop and recovery in a trading day since October of 2008. Eesh.

So why does Shark Tank matter? Shark Tank is a ratings monster. There‚Äôs a reason it is first up in prime time every single day on CNBC. There‚Äôs a reason I watch it every day other than just wishing I could make a bunch of fucking money for some other reason besides just all the money I plan to make on GME (so I could then throw it all into GME and make more). But besides all that, it would take a lot for CNBC to just skip over 30 minutes of Shark Tank. They wouldn‚Äôt give up all those eyes for nothing, unless they wanted them on something. And guess what they had on.

They had fucking Cramer. And he was shitting on retail traders like normal, but he was also desperately sending a message. And that message was that we are not in a recession and everything is okay. He tried to say that now is the time to buy. That buying in this uncertain time is the antidote. They gave Cramer 30 whole minutes of Shark Tank time so he could plead with the working man to keep buying, keep bag holding as we veer off of the cliff, because we are veering hard. He knows it, CNBC knows it, they mentioned it on the show. 

They literally said, you can taste it. Regular people can taste it. Wild statistics like the dip and recovery today being the biggest since October 2008 are piling up, we are seeing the writing on the wall clearer and clearer and the dumbest of smooth smooth non-apes who invest in mutual funds are starting to hear little birds telling them something is off. And they‚Äôre starting to question their masters, and CNBC has to take the time to inject an extra fat dose of *it-will-be-okay* to keep grandma and mom and dad buying stock while the market makers and rich investors cash out and jump ship.



TLDR; Shark Tank being interrupted by Cramer telling folks to bag hold harder is the canary in the MSM coal mine.

Per someone‚Äôs suggestion here I‚Äôve changed flair to *Possible DD* from *Speculation/Opinion* - mods disagree, changed back. *needs more data*

This cuntboy had been performing bodywriting tasks for one of the Masters and you may see how it turned out on my profile. It had to dress in its sister's clothing, including bra and panties, and spend the whole session with a pink buttplug in its ass. It also had to make a photo of itself with a strapless strapon in its vagina, but the dildo side inside, so it looks like this cuntboy have a pathetic small hard dick (which is still bigger than this cuntboy's pathetic clit, of course)

This cuntboy has been also ordered to only refer to itself as 'it' and 'cuntboy', and it has been ordered to ask you to propose a new girly name it could use, so you can propose it in the comments - the one with the most upvoted will probably be chosen for me. This cuntboy also has to refer to its vagina as 'she' since vaginas are girly

This cuntboy must provide a detailed descriptions of how its vagina got fucked with the strapon this cuntboy have mentioned. This cuntboy's vagina was of course dripping before it happend so she didn't even need lube as the dildo slipped inside her easily. Cuntboy's smal clitty was aching and throbbing, and cuntboy's vagina was twitching on the cock. She was really sensitive, gripping the cock so tight, and this cuntboy couldn't help but moan like a desperate girl in heat. She was literally gushing, swallowing the cock like a fleshlight, and this cuntboy loved it. Its vagina was really pink and plump when it finished

This cuntboy also had to of course shave its vagina clean, since silly little girls have no hair down there, so now she's completely visible and her lips and clitty pokes out in a very silly way and this cuntboy can feel her getting wet when it wears panties, because getting rid of the hair made its vagina really sensitive and wet

This cuntboy was then ordered to make an account on [chaster](https://chaster.app/user/DeniedCuntboy) and start a lock. Its vagina is now locked and she's only allowed to edge. This cuntboy is also not allowed to pee as per rules of the lock

You can still add tasks for this cuntboy or force it to publish its cunt and body on Reddit! You're also welcome to message this cuntboy and laugh at how silly, pathetic and desperate its vagina is",21 [FTM4A] cuntboy offering its body for Reddit - an update,2.0,2.0

If she really is being over prescribed, he could contact the prescription drug monitoring program and say hey I‚Äôm really worried about this person I think they‚Äôre being over prescribed here‚Äôs her information please take a look at what‚Äôs going on. Obviously they‚Äôre not going to tell him anything, but if they look at it and it‚Äôs not cool, they will do something. I had a loved one who is snorting at least 90 mg of Adderall a day. Probably more because he would run out before the end of the month. He thought people were trying to kill him, some lady backed into him in a parking lot and he thought she had marked his car so he could be driven off the road later, he thought the police were out to get him and harassing him, it was bad. So I called the state prescription drug monitoring program and I said look I don‚Äôt know who this person‚Äòs doctor is or even if the prescriptions are OK, but he is not OK. I actually think it did some good because before he died his prescription has been reduced to only two 30 mg a day instead of three,  he had found a stable home instead of being homeless for years, he was working a job, I don‚Äôt know if the reduced Adderall prescription and the improved quality of life were connected, I don‚Äôt know if he reduced his dose on his own or if his doctor insisted on it or if the state contacted his doctor and said what the fuck are you doing, but I know that when he reduced his dose to two a day instead of three his life miraculously started to come together.",Doesn‚Äôt every state have a prescription drug monitoring program now?,2.0,2.0

You claim to worry about the issues of supposed oppressed groups and yet you do not care about the common man, who inevitably gets fucked at the end of the day. But no, standing up for our right not to sell my ass 40 hours a week for minimum wage is apparently a form of populism at this point.

At the end of the day all you support is uncontrolled, unsustainable ""economic growth"" (read: the poor get poorer and the rich richer) while you slowly deplete the entire planet's resources. But I guess putting a colorful rainbow flag on it makes it look good. You condemn ""regimes"" like China that have successfully improved material conditions for literal billions of people and shill for enlightened ""democratic"" nations like the US, which have supported literal fascist coups overseas, are barely democratic (two parties, which are basically the same right wing organization, 100% bought by corporations and billionaires) committed countless war crimes, crimes against humanity and still do unthinkable atrocities in places like Guantanamo Bay. All of this out of sheer economic interest. Seeing fucking numbers go up is all you care about, while the rest of the world, such as the African countries you abuse for cheap manufacturing, including child labor, starves to death. All in the name of ""freedom"" and ""democracy"".

You should take a reality check. Your vision of the world is distorted and you are behind most of the problems of our society. Fuck you. Fuck you fuck you, from the bottom of my heart.

Anyway thanks to a connection I have at a company with several branches (I'm in MediaCity Salford) with another branch down south I found out over the Christmas break that Gervais and Merchant are in pre production to put a mock detective series into production! They didn't say what it was called but it basically sounds like Jezzock! They didn't say what it was called because it turns out that the insider is actually a little monkey fella but if I put that bit of info at the end of this post then you'll likely have already scanned to the bottom of the post already to make sure this isn't one of those. So there, I've popped it in the middle to hide it better. Anyway, now I need to engage Bullshit man to pad out the rest of this post. 

So based on the usual production life cycle I think it's on target for early summer on sky I think. It's not going to star Ricky for reasons I've already mentioned above. But I think it's going to be a really funny series now that they're working together again. Based on what I've heard, it's going to parody some of the more modern series you see on Netflix.

s0pclj,"Be consistent, coherent and concise. 

Consistent - Keep a good balance of description, action, dialogue and narration. In the first few pages, your writing is a promise that it will stay that way for the rest of the piece. Any big changes would be noticeable and pull the reader out of the work. More things that can make writing inconsistent include  grammar mistakes, tense changes, unexplained plot points and writing style changes.

Coherent - This is the whole point of writing: to make sense, so your message reaches the readers. Many writers like to sacrifice coherency for trying to sound intellectual or meaningful. It's okay to break your writing rules for the sake of making sense. It's one of the most important reasons why we write. 

Concise - Be specific with everything. That's not a tree; it's a birch. He wasn't jumping; he was diving. Being concise helps with immersion. Bonus points if it's an interesting detail that you wouldn't see anywhere else (while of course still making sense).

Writing can get complicated really fast. A lot of the rules out there stem from these three C's. Immersion and understanding of a piece are the the most important aspects of writing and reading. With the 3 C's, it makes writing a lot easier to understand. 

I hope they helps!

s12d2t,[deleted],Seems like I‚Äôm always spreading my legs‚Ä¶,,
s67dab,"Hello all, I've made a few posts on here before with plays that actually hit when I spend a few hours/days doing some actual SOLID DD.

If you scan my posts, you'll notice all my option plays hit. There is a reason for this.

Aside from noticing when to jump into the trade, or noticing where a good setup is, a bunch of people send me messages asking me what I look for when evaluating a good trade or how I know a good trade is going to come within the next few weeks or months.

This is some of the basic stuff I look for every single time I think about opening a position on a stock. I am going to try to break this down as simple as I can since I am paraphrasing from the free-education section of the Discord I run.

1. Find the stock or ticker. Perhaps you heard of this company through a friend or with positive news? Is this your first time looking at the stock? Doesn't matter. Open the chart, put it on the D (daily) or W (weekly) chart. LOOK AT THE BIGGER PICTURE. Are you in a downtrend? Uptrend? What is going on with the stock? Have people been pushing it up for 2 weeks and you're just NOW thinking about getting calls? NO!
2. **THIS IS THE PART WE ARE REALLY LOOKING AT :** What are their fundamentals? You want to look at 2 big things here above all else. **Free flow cash, and Long term debt.** These are the 2 most important things I look at when I determine if I am going to BUY(long) or SELL(short) a position. There is no exceptions. This is also what big name institutions are going to look at right off the rip aswell. They will ask themselves **""Why would I invest in a company that cannot produce a profit?""**

Example

&#x200B;

[ZIM FINANCIALS](https://preview.redd.it/eqowjv9zs9c81.png?width=1663&format=png&auto=webp&s=96a587e62cac966445a2000fdf5c4b7a1e220e2f)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[ZIM CHART](https://preview.redd.it/s6ho7xk1t9c81.png?width=1150&format=png&auto=webp&s=48c6445289d6314d66038a27a32927a19d777604)

&#x200B;

Now, let's compare this to... idk, PLTR for instance since so many morons love this company who's CEO get's lost in the woods smoking weed and making insane investor videos that never work out.

&#x200B;

[PLTR FINANCIALS](https://preview.redd.it/vx2c5ff5t9c81.png?width=1677&format=png&auto=webp&s=980bc7385a22a58b59c81b7777bef27a3159d2be)

And the chart

&#x200B;

3. Great, now we know which companies to look for and which ones to avoid, but where do we find such great companies that are safer bets than these other cheap ones? The answer is all around you. Think, what companies will ALWAYS be around? I'm not talking about tech companies or that kind of thing, what are humans ALWAYS going to **NEED?** Housing, Food, Energy, (all types) Safety, Materials, etc. Keep in mind, you're separating the NEED from the WANT here,

**HD is a need. It is not a want.**  
**COST is a need. It is not a want.**

Big investment companies know this, and they will always buy these stocks, no matter what.

These are companies that will ALWAYS be around unless something catastrophic happens. I pulled up a chart of some 500 companies and circled the ones I would choose to go after.

https://preview.redd.it/kbnfb7qat9c81.png?width=741&format=png&auto=webp&s=869a89f5bd90391528ac124d17cff3c5b6765367

&#x200B;

4. Okay great, Now we found what company we want to buy, we found out multiple other things aswell. We found out if the company **ADDS VALUE** to the rest of the world and that is what makes it attractive to both new and old investors. We found out that this company will keep going up, aside from some minor setbacks and profit taking. We found out that overall, a long term play on this company is **MORE THAN LIKELY** going to work out. Awesome and great.

5. The setup

Alright, now let's say we wanna buy some company that will yield us a good return (long calls/ stock) like COST or HD. Let's pull up the charts then.

&#x200B;

[COST CHART](https://preview.redd.it/31lfq3tct9c81.png?width=1155&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb1717b3dbb4990a93c072a4f311744448e6847d)

&#x200B;

Naturally, we want to want to **LOAD AT SUPPORT**. (IE: WHERE THE RED LINE IS ON THIS CHART OR BELOW IT AT PREVIOUS SUPPORT) Not just randomly jump into a run on a random day at a random time. (If you are DAYTRADING, that is completely different)

I am about to give you guys a huge secret on how to make fat cash because I see so many other people do it. When you see the stock hit the 100/180 SMA, this is where you load. This is where all the ""heavy/smart/big"" investors will also load. They load here with long dated calls and lots of stock, and they fucking wait 1-3 months to reap the rewards. Generally this occurs more on an ETF than a stock, but a good stock will have this happen aswell. Don't believe me? Okay, let's check out the SPY to compare.

&#x200B;

[SPY DAILY \(d\) CHART](https://preview.redd.it/3zztrhmet9c81.png?width=1734&format=png&auto=webp&s=de4772f298055dec8111ad6510419857fe809fc3)

&#x200B;

Funny, seems that if you loaded 1-3 month out spy calls every time in the last 2 years that the SPY hit the 100/180ish SMA it always rebounded. Government buying or not, it's what happened. EVERY SINGLE TIME, if you bought 1-3 month out calls, they would have printed. **EVERY, SINGLE, TIME**.

I believe this is also called ""The Golden Rule"" or some other super smart investor term, idk.

So, to summarize what we have learned: We find good companies with good financials and good backing, put it on our watchlist and set alerts for key points of support. We trade the confirmation, not the hunch. Like if you're day trading, you trade the breakout not the chart.

I hope this makes sense to everyone I've tried to make it as simple as possible, if you have any questions please feel free to comment below or DM me directly. If you feel like I am wrong in any way with what I have said here, then please, feel free to make your own post.

Side note: I am not some kind of Jim Simmons Guru, nor do I claim to be. Just someone that knows how this stuff works on a machine-like aspect.

Hope this helps.

EDIT: To answer multiple questions at once, Webull doesn't have an SMA button, it's either EMA or MA, so I just added more EMA indicators and adjusted the settings to where the SMA's should be.

I would probably add JnJ and Proctor Gamble to the list of NEEDS aswell. Pfizer makes a lot of drugs sure, but they are not JnJ or PG.","How I pick better winning trades, here ya go",2.0,2.0

rtdpr6,"I have changed my opinon on this post and have made a [new post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ruaoux/student_loans_will_not_cause_the_next_crash/)

TL;DR: Student loans are getting out of control and the average American is struggling to pay back. Once Biden's student loan pause stops the debt market might spiral out of control.

Okay ill make my thesis pretty clear from the start:Americans aren't able to pay their student loans back.

A pretty simple thesis right? In my opinion, yes, it's a lot simpler than mortgages.

The subprime mortgage crash of 2008 was caused by, in short terms, people not being able to afford paying their mortgages after their teaser rates expired.Theres a myriad of other ways to explain it and  thats just what I think. People were getting loans they obviously couldn't pay.They ignored the rates in the long term because they were being blinded with the misconceptions that they could always refinance their terms. This was obviously wrong, but the issuers didn't give a shit, because it made them rich. So they kept on dishing out loans to people even with shitty credit scores.

This time however Americas debt problems have taken a different turn. The student loan market is very different from the mortgage market. Obviously the market is smaller, but student loans are still the second largest consumer debt with a market of 1.6 trillion USD. The crazy thing is that the average debt incurred by students to fund their seminary education is $33,000. While the student loans cause less debt than mortgages they also often have worse terms. Issuers tend to focus on the principal amount owed while ignoring the interest that accumulates. This can really mess some people up when  in their later years of college they realise that they might need to take an extra semester to pass. Student debt can also set a stopper on getting a mortgage. If you spend say 10 or 15% on your student debt, getting a mortgage where you pay say 35% can be impossible. Student debt is also harder to refinance as fewer private issuers include refinancing in their terms, and with federal loans it forfeits key consumer protections.If you go bankrupt you cant discharge your loan without proving that your issuer is causing you ""undue hardship"". In mortgages all of these things are much easier to do and the debt market is obviously much more regulated.

So far I have only talked about how student loans are rigged against the average American. However one of the most pressing issues are the unjust rising costs of college. Ill let this chart speak for itself: [https://i.huffpost.com/gen/1192706/images/o-COLLEGE-COSTS-facebook.jpg](https://i.huffpost.com/gen/1192706/images/o-COLLEGE-COSTS-facebook.jpg)

Biden recently extended the Student debt forgiveness act. This is obviously bearish. This can be compared to the teaser rates running out and people not being able to afford their payments. As people haven't had to pay student loans in a while now, it is fair to say the part of their income that went to student debt has gone to other things. Maybe restaurants, maybe a new car with more debt etc... This basically means that people are going to be struggling to find money to repay their loans with.

So, how can we profit off of this? I would say credit default swaps. However i dont really know the credit derivatives market well and maybe someone in the comments has a better idea?

I dont really know how this is going to play out on the markets. But its going to be interesting.

rxqyzp,"I have heard it many times ""you (men) don't want an intelligent woman because you are just intimidated, you can't handle her"" or ""you (men) just want a less intelligent girl so you can control her"" and sure enough, there are some men like that. 

There are more then one issues with this. First, it's not true that men don't want intelligent women. We do want intelligent women, we do enjoy meaningful, intellectual conversations and genuine humor, none of which is possible without intelligence.

Second, this usually comes up when someone says, we generally do not prioritize intelligence over other traits usually associated with femininity (like compassion or aggreablness for instance) or even fitness. But this doesn't mean that we want to be with a 20 yo fitness model who's IQ is only slightly higher then a hen's so she wont poo around the porch.

Third, as far as i can tell, this and similar phrases are gaslighting techniques commonly used by some women who focused solely on their studies while neglected other traits that are generally more important to us, hence are being rejected by men or unable to get commitment. 

No, we are not intimidated by an intelligent woman, we simply prioritize other traits before intelligence, and if those traits are neglected, it doesn't matter how intelligent the person is. There's no need to construct anything more then that behind the phenomenon.","Men are not intimidated by intelligent women, this is simply not where our priorities are",2.0,2.0
s77bg1,"There was a post on here recently asking what people thought were the best designed jobs in EW, and I'm curious to hear what everyone thinks are the worst jobs and why. I went through most of the responses on the 'best' thread and figured I would compile the jobs that didn't get any responses, and make the case as for why people might think they need changes. 

-SMN: The rework is pretty contentious, and while it isn't all bad, the rigidity of the rotation and the extreme simplicity of the job compared to it's ShB iteration just makes it look rough. It also has a distinct lack of casting for a Caster job, with SAM now using more cast gcds per minute than SMN. On a personal level, I wish they kept some of the dot mage identity that the job used to have, old SMN had one of the most engaging rotations in the game and the comparison between the two versions is pretty jarring. 

-DRK: At this point DRK is just WAR with a purple coat of paint, and worse self-sustain. Tanks have arguably suffered the most from job homogenization and DRK is the biggest offender. You could switch your WAR keybinds with their DRK equivalents and they would map on 90% identically. Add to that a janky invuln that costs more healer resources than the others, no real form of self sustain to help cover that weakness, pretty miserable changes compared to the other tanks in EW, and the fact that blood weapon still hasn't been changed, and there's a lot that needs to be fixed. It was lucky this tier due to being the highest dps tank, but that doesn't really justify all of the jank and uninteresting changes made or left alone with EW. I would make the case that DRK could use a full rework to differentiate it from WAR and recapture the original job identity that has been slowly eroded over time from HW onwards. 

-WHM: While the 1.5 gcd made SCH feel much smoother and fixed a lot of the issues people had with the class, it seems like the WHM changes did not fully understand what changing the glare gcd to 1.5 would do to the class. Between holy and glare potency issues, the disincentivizing of using lilies due to potency loss, and thin air changes causing pretty massive mana issues, WHM definitely feels like a step down from its relatively good spot in ShB. WHM wasn't designed as an ogcd healer, so when you give it a 1.5 gcd without adjusting the job accordingly, it ends up feeling off when compared to the other healers, which are all in pretty good spots.

These are just observations I've seen and experienced, but I don't main these jobs so I don't have a full picture on their previous versions and their optimization at a high end. I'm curious to hear what jobs you all feel play the 'worst' in EW and what fixes you would like to see implemented.","What do you think is the ""worst"" designed job in EW?",2.0,2.0

s7ix04,"I decided to write a second post describing the sex in detail because it turns me on to relive through storytelling.   
  
Here is the first post in case you missed it: https://www.reddit.com/r/sexstories/comments/s7dkhr/i\_have\_a\_confession\_i\_would\_like\_to\_make\_i/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3  
  
We made it to my hotel room and he immediately pressed his full weight into me pushing me against the door. He is at least 6 inches taller than me so I looked up at him as he leaned down to kiss me. The electricity I felt between us was incredible as he pushed his tongue into my mouth.   
  
There was so much heat and energy between us while we kissed and shredded our clothes off each other's bodies. He was strong. I could feel my spine tingle when he picked me up without much effort and walked me to the bed. He laid me down wearing what was left of my business suit, just my stocking and panties left to remove. I centered myself on the bed as he climbed onto it pushing my legs up in the air so he could slide the rest of my clothes off. The cool air felt good against my hot pussy soaking wet from anticipation. He bent down placing both of his strong hands under my butt and proceeded to lick all around my labia sensually. I could feel the desire from him as he enjoyed going down on me, something my husband hasn‚Äôt done in forever.   
  
As he was licking my pussy  I remember having a moment realizing I was fully cheating. I started to feel guilty but pushed those thoughts out quickly. I didn‚Äôt care. The relief I felt was overpowering, finally releasing all my tension. He slid a finger then two inside me and made me cum after several minutes. I don't normally cum that quickly. My body was still quivering lightly when he stood up next to the bed and unbuttoned his pants.   
  
Without hesitation I knew that was my que. I was excited to get to taste his cock in my mouth. I slid off the bed and went to my knees helping him pull his cock out of his briefs. I had never really cared that much about the size of a penis until I saw his. My hand didn't even wrap all the way around it as I held it in my hand looking at it mouthing ‚Äúoh my god‚Äù. He tasted wonderful. My mouth was full of a rock hard cock and I was so into it. I sucked him as hard and deep as I could. The size made me drool. I had to use both of my hands and worked his cock for several minutes eventually exhausting myself and my jaw.  
  
I pulled off of him and sat at his feet looking up at his glistening cock and asked him if he had a condom. I wanted him to fuck me bad but I was paranoid of getting pregnant among other things. I always make my husband wear one on top of my birth control, the standard two protection method just to be safe. He didn‚Äôt have one but offered to go down to the lobby to get some. I contemplated what to do as my pussy ached for him. I decided to listen to my body. I wanted him raw.  
  
I told him not to worry about it and got back on the bed. Without hesitation he joined leaning over me between my legs pressing his hard cock against my opening. We embraced there for a minute looking at each other as he teased my opening with his cock head. It was big, too big. I was nervous it wouldn't fit. I think he could sense it because he just told me to relax as he took control. He opened me up slowly slicking his head and shaft with my fluids. He was firm but sensual. After a while he started pressing into me without  breaking eye contact. I felt safe under him, relaxed even. It felt like every nerve in my vagina woke up because of the amount of pressure his cock was putting on the walls of my vagina. He was slowly stretching me further than I had ever gone. He told me to breathe and I realized I was holding my breath.   
  
I took a deep breath and I felt my body open up to him. He was in. We stayed like that for a few minutes and he told me to describe the feeling. All I could come up with was ‚ÄúFull‚Äù. His cock then started pulling out and back into me when he bucked his hips. It felt great. He fucked me like that for awhile before pulling out of me and I saw how creamy I made his shaft. ‚ÄúIs that from me I shouted‚Äù I had never done that before. He chuckled and turned me around pulling me up by my hips entering me from behind.   
  
I felt so vulnerable and more turned on then I can remember after seeing how my body was responding to him. With the smell of sex in the air I started moaning loudly as he thrusted into me. I loved how assertive he was. He didn‚Äôt ask for permission to spank me or pull apart my butt cheeks as he ran a finger over my hole. I felt like his possession. I loved it. I felt like an animal. I had one purpose and that purpose was to fuck.   
  
He pulled me up by my arms and wrapped his hands around my throat from behind and that is when I started cumming listening to the wet noises emanating from my stretched out pussy. I quivered and shook while screaming. He kept fucking me. I remember him moving around positions but I honestly get blurry around this part because I felt like a passenger. He was using my body however he wanted. He was pinching my nipples, spanking me, pulling my hair and rubbing my clit. I know I came several times before He finally told me to beg for his cum.  
  
I did as I was told and he came deep inside me while I was on my back and my legs were on his broad shoulders. His cum felt warm as it shot into me. It had been awhile since someone came inside me. I loved it. We stayed like that until his cock stopped throbbing inside of me and he pulled his way out. He stood up again next to me but this time grabbing the back of my head and nudged me towards his cock. I gladly complied and licked the mixture of cum and myself off of his dick. I felt like an addict. I loved every drop. I wasn't disgusted at all tasting my cream and his cum.  
  
He laid down next to me after that and held me in his arms. I just looked at his hot naked body as I replayed what just happened in my head, my legs still trembling. I saw his cock get hard again as my boobs were pressed into his side. I started getting excited again. He pulled me on top of him and I slid his cock inside me again. I felt vulnerable somehow even being on top. He grabbed me by my hips and pushed up with his legs sliding me up and down on him.   
  
I rode him for a while as he played with my ass and sucked on my nipples. I came again. He turned me around and I rode him in reverse cowgirl hard, I came again. I couldn‚Äôt believe I was still able to go but I wanted more and more every time. I had never felt like that during sex. Every time I came he started fingering my G Spot, ramping the intensity back up. I was gushing for him. He came again inside me this time while he stood up fucking me at the edge of the couch in the hotel room. I watched his cum trickle out of me after he pulled his cock out. I was exhausted. We had been fucking for over three hours. I crawled into his arms and fell asleep.  
  
  
I woke up in the middle of the night to him running his hands up and down my naked body. Somehow I had become the little spoon and could feel his cock pressing against my butt. I couldn't believe he was hard again. He kissed my neck and played with my nipples so sensually and softly. I was half asleep as he slid his cock between my legs and into my pussy. I felt tight again but not as tight as before. My pussy started doing its job and slicking his cock up for us. He fucked me so slowly. I felt taken care of. He made me cum again but this time from his hand over my clit reaching around my body. He came for the third time inside me like that and after a quick trip to pee I fell back asleep next to him.   
  
The next morning I woke up and it was bright outside. The incredible sex I had from last night flooded my brain followed by guilt. I didn‚Äôt stay in that headspace long before I looked at the hotel clock and realized I already missed my return  flight. I was so caught up in everything I completely forgot to set an alarm. My phone was dead and I knew my husband would be freaking out on me. I got my phone charger and looked at the naked man laying in my hotel bed before locking myself in the bathroom. I had about 20 texts, some from him and my coworkers saying he was contacting them to make sure I was safe. I called him and explained I was okay. I just crashed out hard when I laid down and was out. He knew I had been stressed over this pitch so it is not uncommon for me to sleep for a long time after a big project.   
  
We hung up the phone after he helped me book a flight the next morning and I extended my stay at the hotel. We will call him John but John talked to his wife explaining he had more work to do to finish out the project. It was a relaxed conversation he was having like he had done this before. I pushed aside my temporary jealous feelings, guilt feelings and snuggled next to him. We talked a bit about how incredible the night was and that led to some making out. I felt so good in his arms. So wanted, so desired. We broke the kiss by the sound of his stomach grumbling. We were both starving.   
  
We had to get a door dash to deliver due to covid not allowing room service and devoured the burritos we ordered. We didn‚Äôt talk much but focused on eating. After we were fed I wanted to take a shower and he joined me. We really were enjoying each other. We didn‚Äôt talk about anything heavy as we washed each other's bodies and I pushed any guilt to the back of my mind. After we both cleaned ourselves and before we left the shower we started again. He was Kissing me and rubbing my breast, working his hands around my clit. He was masterful the way he manipulated my clit with his fingers, rotating perfectly to get me excited.   
  
  
I was on the verge of cumming again when he stopped and pushed me to my knees and I took his cock in my mouth again. I loved sucking on it. I played with his balls more this time feeling how heavy they still were despite all the fucking we had already done.   
  
  
I could taste precum all over my tongue just before he pulled out. He picked me up and I wrapped my legs around his waist and he balanced me against the shower wall while sliding his cock into me. It felt incredible. I had never been fucked like that before. Weightless bouncing on him. His arms flexing around me was enough to make me cum for the whatever time I was up to. We smiled at each other after we both came and rinsed off again in the shower.   
  
We spent the next few hours talking and connecting. He asked about things I liked and wanted sexually that I wasn‚Äôt getting. It was weird how comfortable I already was talking to this relative stranger about some of my more private kinks. I told him how much I liked how he took control and made me feel vulnerable to him. I told him how I desire humiliation in a certain way and how what I like the most is just feeling like I'm doing something naughty I shouldn‚Äôt be. We also spent time talking about my sex life at home and how unfulfilling it was. After a while we went and found lunch together.   
  
We made plans to spend the evening together but we agreed it was best for him not to sleep over again so I didn‚Äôt miss my flight. We cuddled and rested in the room after lunch. I was exhausted. My vagina hurt and my body was sore everywhere. I felt alive though and happy. I dozed off next to him and woke up to him rubbing my shoulder. He moved in to kiss me softly. We started making out and I rolled on top of him straddling him on the bed then he stopped me. He said he had a surprise for me but it required me to trust him. He wanted to play on a kink I shared. I felt nervous but trusted him fully as he held me. I agreed and his mood shifted to more instructional. He rolled me off of him and told me to strip down while he grabbed a sleeping shirt out of my bag and one of my sweaters.  
  
Before I could process he laid me on my stomach and pulled my arms behind my back firmly tieing my wrists together with the shirt then used the sweater to tie my ankles together. He then grabbed his belt out of his pants on the ground and tightened it  around the shirt and sweater leaving me face down, legs bent back in the air and arms back. I was unable to move. I got excited and nervous.   
  
He asked me how it felt and I told him I can feel myself getting wet. He laughed but not in a friendly way. He walked over and ran his finger up and down my slit confirming how wet I was getting. ‚ÄúYou really are a kinky little slut‚Äù. He hadn‚Äôt talked to me that way before. A shot of arousal went down my spine accompanied by fear.   
  
I knew that he was acting and I was safe because I described this type of fantasy earlier to him but it still felt so real. He checked again if I was comfortable , I nodded.  He then made me tell him what a cheating kinky slut I am as he teased my pussy. I complied. He then pulled his cock out and put it in my mouth for a few seconds before pulling it back out and out of my reach. Each time he pulled out he made me beg him to let me suck it again.  
  
I think a strong breeze from the Air conditioning would have made me cum at that point. I felt so vulnerable, dirty and under his control. He pinched my nipples and kept commenting on my body. Each tiny blemish, pulling at the skin commenting on it. I felt so exposed. He spread apart my butt cheeks and spit on my asshole before rubbing it. He made me beg him to play with my asshole. It was humiliating and exactly what I wanted.   
  
He continued to tease my body and make me verbally degrade myself for what felt like forever. I laid in silence as he left the room and came back with some food and drink from the store in the lobby. Something I specifically shared was that I wanted to be left tied up alone. He untied me and repositioned me on my back. He retied my ankles together and my wrists, I was helpless again but dripping down my butt crack. He lifted my legs and commented on how wet I was again. I felt embarrassed. He fingered me and licked me until I was about to cum and he stopped. I was going crazy. He teased all around my body eventually pulling his cock down and fucking me for awhile and pulling out. He was methodical. slow. He made me beg for everything he did to me. It was twisted and hot.   
  
Finally he was building me up to cum and he let me go over the edge while holding my legs in the air and rubbing my clit with his thumb. I screamed and moaned as I came. It started getting very sensitive but he didn‚Äôt stop. He kept rubbing my clit until it started to hurt. I tried to reach out to pull his hand away but my wrists were tied. My body tried to sit up but he leaned on top of me so I couldn't move while still firmly holding my legs in place. I started to beg for him to stop but he just looked at me, nonverbally communicating to me to trust him. I decided to not say anything. He kept rubbing my clit. It started to hurt really bad as my body squirmed. I was in pain and pleasure at the same time. I could feel another orgasm building and the second one was more intense then the first one.   
  
He untied me after that and let me lay out on the bed quivering in pleasure/pain, my pussy throbbing and my mind racing. We talked about how I felt and what I liked. He made sure I was okay before fucking me one more time before putting me to bed. He waited until I fell asleep and left. I woke up the next morning sore all over again but happy.","[Part 2, the details] I have a confession I would like to make. I cheated on my husband. I feel guilty but I don't regret it.",1.0,2.0

rg7t0p,"A friend encouraged me to finally share some of my stories on here. Apparently I'm a good stupid slut so maybe some of you will enjoy it. This happened a few years back but still makes me smile. 

A little background grew up catholic (school girl skirts and all) so i started my sex life pretty late in life but boy did i make up for lost time. Lost my virginity to a guy i barely knew on a friend's mom's living room floor and it didn't get better from there but that's a different story. I want to tell you the story of my first anal experience (F19 at the time). I'm a tall blonde with large boobs, hourglass figure and a baby face. Especially after high school when i started wearing more tight shirts i got a decent amount of attention. 

Typical ""meet cute"" for a slut met a guy at a bar he grabbed me, kissed me then introduced himself. I was with a friend who I promised i would go home with so that was all that happened then but he did have my number. A week later he texted and i went over to his after a couple drinks and a little teasing.

We're quickly naked and I'm teasing the tip of his cock with my mouth when he grabs my head apparently not willing to wait any longer. He can tell how wet I'm becoming by my moans as he's roughly face fucking me. My eyes watering he tells me i make a very pretty mess. This only turns me on more and i ask desperately if he could please fuck me. He says i deserve something else first. He asks if I've ever tried anal i say no he's only my second sexual partner. Judging by his face this is the perfect response. He tells me he will first need to see exactly how tight my virgin asshole is. There is something very degrading and incredibly hot in that moment when he sticks his fingers in my mouth and tells me i better do a good job making them wet enough. Using my spit for lube teases one of his fingers in. At this point I'm so turned on I'm begging for more and one turns to two easily. He tells me since i am a very good slut he will give me a treat and fill me up for my first time so that i really know what it's like to be used. Bending me over, using his spit, he slowly works his cock in from behind and starts to really work into a rhythm. I think I'm going to cum immediately, i tell him. He reminds me this is not for my pleasure but his so I'm not allowed to and slows down so that i dont. True to his word he came in my ass and had me lick the cum off his cock before i was allowed to clean up a bit. 

I only got to cum the next day after working really hard for it. But by then i do think i deserved it.",Sweet memories of slutty experiences,2.0,2.0

sgqr5v,"So to give context to this story, two years ago I was a huge player, dating and a girs every week, having s3x leaving, one night stands and all, but there was this one girl I got with and after it it turned out she had boyfriend. Even though I was an asshole I couldn‚Äôt not tell the dude as I would need to know too, I told the guy about what happened and he confronted his girl. His girl not wanting to seem like a cheater said I r*ped her and forced her into it. This was then taken to the police and I was investigated, I was able to stop the case before it went anywhere because I had messages of her begging to get with me and saying she‚Äôd do anything for me‚Ä¶. Fast forward two years I‚Äôm a different person, I‚Äôm engaged and getting ready to buy a house, and in the last 7 months I started squashing beef (clearing the air) with people I had problems with. These things ranged from people who I had a horrible break up with to just people I didn‚Äôt like in middle school and we gave each other dirty looks. I don‚Äôt like the thought that someone hates me for something I did and didn‚Äôt apologize for. I get people are gonna dislike me but if they‚Äôre gonna dislike me I atleast want to say sorry so for myself I can prove I‚Äôm not that person anymore , the person they hate. But anyways moving on, I want to clear the air with this girl but because of how delicate the situation is I don‚Äôt know if I, what if she accuses me of harassment or stalking‚Ä¶. I have massive anxiety, what should I do?

Edit: to everyone who‚Äôs given me the advice to block, thank you I really appreciate it. I have made the decision not too and all the support from you guys means a lot as this was a huge part of my life that if I didn‚Äôt fix I would be in jail, so thank you all for the support.


Edit #2: the main reason I wanted to contact (I have decided not to thanks to everyone here ‚ù§Ô∏è) but the main reason I wanted to contact was because I wanted to ask if she really believed I did r*pe her, and to also tell her I‚Äôm not mad at her anymore‚Ä¶ (I still am hurt but not mad) but after hearing everyone‚Äôs advice I see how dumb of an idea that is.",Should I clear the air with someone who falsely accused me of r*pe in my past‚Ä¶.,2.0,2.0

ru4t8e,"I got a good one that happened to me last year. I was biking from Seoul to Busan. The first motel of the trip, the guy at the counter is very nice. He gives me some water, helps bring in my bike and is very friendly. This motel obviously gets a lot of bikers doing the same thing so they are well prepared. 

My room is on the second floor. My bike had a lot of bags, water bottles and all that strapped on to it (five day trip) he holds my bike, looks at the stairs... looks back at the bike. I could tell he was thinking this would be heavy. He's probably 50, not old but not terribly young either. 

This is where i swooped in, wanting to say that I will do it! I'll carry the bike up there, he doesn't need to! 

So... I said ""Ìï† Ïàò ÏûàÏñ¥Ïöî!"" I know he heard me, but he didn't really look at me (I was behind him) and off he went... lifting my bike. Huh? As you already know, I basically said to him ""you can do it!"" Since I omitted the subject. I should of said ""Ï†úÍ∞Ä Ìï† Ïàò ÏûàÏñ¥Ïöî!"" Or ""Ï†úÍ∞Ä Ìï†Í≤åÏöî""

I realized this once I was in my hotel room. Good amount of cringe that gave me. He was still friendly after that the next day, but... damn. What's funny is I spoke to him in Korean before that, so it's not like he would think ""oh foreigner just getting mixed up"" my Korean level was good enough that there could be no mistaking what he thought I meant.

I have an issue where occasionally I will have an infection flare up. 

I had an appointment scheduled on Monday morning 9am with the Dr to assess the issue.  This appointment was at the end of the first round of antibiotics.  The Dr (nurse practioner I think) agreed that the infection had not cleared and more antibiotics were needed.  I was told that they would send the prescription to my pharmacy.  They also wanted to refer me to a different specialist.  I had no issues with the referral.  I leave their office about 9:30am.

About 2:00pm that day, I go to my pharmacy.  I find out the prescription hasn't been called in.  Strange.  I call the Dr office and they tell me that they send in all prescriptions at the end of the day.  Seems odd to me but okay.  I was out of antibiotics and I still had an active infection and they are going to wait until the end of the day to call in my prescription.  I went home and waited for a notified from the pharmacy.  It never came.

Tuesday morning, I call the pharmacy.  They has not received anything yet.  So another call to the Dr office.  I tell the person answering the phone my issue, she transfers me to the nurse to leave a voice mail.  No return call, no prescription.  In the meantime the infection is flaring up and getting worse since I am not taking antibiotics.  I had to take a couple of pain pills left over from a recent surgery Tuesday night to sleep.

Wednesday morning.  Call the pharmacy, no prescription.  Call the Dr office, explain the situation again, tell them the infection is getting worse, I get routed to the same voice mail.  I leave a message and then call right back.  I explain that I had left a message yesterday and repeated that things were getting worse.  They tell me that they will deliver the message in person.  I get a call back 30 minutes later from nurse.  She acts like it's no big deal.  I repeat that things are getting worse and this prescription was supposed to be call in on Monday and it's now Wednesday.  She tells me that they will send it in just a few minutes.  This was at 9:30am.  I'll just say that I wasn't overwhelmed with confidence at her reply.

I head to an urgent care.  Urgent care Doc sends in a prescription for 2 different antibiotics to my pharmacy.  I picked them up at 3pm and the original prescription has yet to be submitted. 

I'm glad they referred me to a different Dr because I don't want to go back to this one after this.",Dr's office failed to call in prescription for antibiotics.,2.0,2.0

I see this as no different to someone posing in front of their Lamborghini. I‚Äôd love to have seen more countries and experienced different cultures, but these things cost lots of money which I‚Äôve not been lucky enough to have.

Edit: this blew up more than I was expecting.

Erm, to the minority who are stating that I‚Äôm jealous etc. There‚Äôs definitely a little bit of jealousy because of course I‚Äôd love to have these experiences, I just can‚Äôt. But the thing that I don‚Äôt like is that these people are flaunting it in everyone‚Äôs face, in the same way that someone could afford a nice sports car or whatever...my parents raised me to be humble and not to shove my success or luck down people‚Äôs throats. I am happy for people to be successful and have nice things.

There was a lots of drinking so of course I got drunk, after the party I ended up taking a Uber home when I got in the Uber I could really see him eyeing me up he was probably in his 30s. we started some small talk back and forth, And I started flirting with him which made him put his hand on my thigh, as we were talking he moving his hand up and  down my thigh slowly getting closer to my pussy. 

I could clearly see want he was doing so I spread my legs so he could see that I wasn‚Äôt wearing panties and for a fact he seen right away because he started play and rubbing my pussy right away and he could tell that I‚Äôve been wet for a while now. As he was fingering me, I started grabbing and squeezing my boobs and moaning loudly. Which made him pull into a dark empty park parking lot, where I started to giving him a blowjob his cock was pretty big (probably around 7 or 8 inches) that I was taking in the mouth, He lasted about five minutes which he came when he slammed my head down onto his cock making his cock hit the back throat allowing him to cum right down my throat. 

After that we got into the back seat when I ended up riding him, the sex was amazing one second he was playing with my boobs licking and sucking on them and the next he would be holding onto them like handles making me moan even louder as I fucked him, he ended up cumming in me twice as I rode him. After that he drive me back home but on the only back I was sucking on his cock and fingering myself I got him to cum two more times before he dropped me at home off I ended up getting out of the car fully naked with cum dripping from my pussy and face and crashing on the couch in my living room.",(F)20 I let uber driver grope and fuck me,1.0,1.0

Hi y'all. Here's my dilemma. 

My college girlfriend cheated on me, and a year later we met and had a rebound. She got pregnant, and we had a son. We moved in together and settled to raise the child. Mid 2020, she wanted another child, but I wasn't ready. So she removed her fp without telling me and she got pregnant again. We had a daughter in 2021. 2 months later, we had a big fight, parents got involved, and we ended things for good. She obviously took the kids with her. I was super close with my son, so the breakup really got to me. I just couldn't deal with not seeing my baby boy. 

Amidst my mini-depression, I had a few encounters with several other girls, and one of them got pregnant! But we can't date because there is no love there. So now next month I will have 3 kids that I can't see. I'm really mad at myself, but my biggest problem is that I want to be a dad so bad. I really miss being a parent. I tried offering this last girl 500k so she could give me custody after the baby is born (she didn't want the child at first anyway), but she refused. I don't want another baby mama, but I want my own baby so bad. Any thoughts? Harsh truths? I really need some constructive advice.

sdhfee,"Been thinking about my past 2 serious relationships lately and noticed a pattern with how they ended. They always ended on my exes terms. It‚Äôs making me think maybe I am the problem. One thing I make very clear at the start of the relationship is that communicating is important to me and is something I practice. On both occasions I was very calm and careful whenever I tried communicating something that was bothering me during our relationships. The first girl broke up with me because I went several hours without replying to her when I was busy working and away from my phone even though I told her the night prior I will be working. I tried everything I could to calmly explain what happened and she thought I was avoiding her when that wasn‚Äôt the case. Still got broken up with anyways by her. The second and my most recent relationship ended because my ex went to a rave dressed in a very revealing outfit without telling me (when I asked her why she didn‚Äôt tell me about her outfit she got defensive and this caused her to break up with me.) I don‚Äôt really care about what a girl wears I just wished she was open and and honest about it because it was a surprise when I found out through social media posts and people asking me about it. Anyways, does anyone else feel like this after being dumped often? Lol",Starting to wonder if I‚Äôm the problem.,2.0,2.0
rzaav9,"I recently lost my Pom (senior rescue).  He was a perfect dog in every way with magical qualities despite being abused and neglected for so many years. I kept on feeling that he's a creature from another enchanted world. He was so funny too. Definitely one of the best things that ever happened in my life. I will always miss him. We only had poodle or poodle-mixed dogs until we found him at the shelter but I'm now a big Pomeranian fan.

Our current ""toy doodle"" rescue is more like an imp. We love him to pieces but obedience training him has been a difficult journey. A friend called him the worst and funniest dog on leash when we first adopted him.

We are not ready for another dog yet but our doodle is very lonely. He misses his brother and every time we see other Poms, he tries to run towards them. While we tend to rescue senior dogs, I am thinking about going to a Pomeranian breeder this time so we can give a dog a happy life from day one to the end. I think dogs deserve that. At the same time, I am a bit worried that we aren't the right fit for young Poms in general. I watched that Pom in agility competition video over and over. I think we can all agree that that particular Pom is a high energy dog who won't be happy being a couch potato.

If we get a dog who needs to exercise a lot, we can manage that but I had a toy poodle that needed a yard despite his size (4 pounds). I know all Poms are different just like all dogs are different and I will ask the breeder for a mellow easygoing puppy but what do you think? Will we make good Pomeranian parents?

Our situation:

\- Small apartment

\- Puppy will not be left alone except 3 up to 3 hours a day, 3 days a week.

\- Our current dog (2 yo) is hyper, super smart, very reactive, and high-need over all

sevgaa,"I love spreadsheets, graphs, data and crypto. So I've collected all the data posted in the Moon distribution .CSV files, made some sense of it all in a spreadsheet, then made us some graphs.

# Total Karma

https://preview.redd.it/roi59nodide81.png?width=926&format=png&auto=webp&s=d71df684c6f2f4b0656f31d6bac413b2f92dd6c5

The Sum of all the karma per round

An 18% decrease since the last round.   
I've added the average BTC price for the 28 day Moon round to this graph as the total karma has seemed to move up and down in line with its price.  
I've done other analysis posts that show we get activity spikes when BTC fluctuates, with the most happening during dips as it seems that misery likes company.

# The ratio of Moons to karma

https://preview.redd.it/jkxi63gfide81.png?width=1448&format=png&auto=webp&s=482723d0b7c52f1a63c57eac94ffa138588db101

The all important Moon to karma ratio. Multiply this number by your karma to determine how many Moons you receive for each round. (Round 12 - 0.88 [Never Forget](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mvzv9v/anyone_remember_that_time_last_week_when_the_moon/))

This number will naturally decline over time as the Moons released per round reduce by 2.5%

# Number of users on .CSV

https://preview.redd.it/630ucxujide81.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=760c0936f201d5e5caf16ad19bd41004ac54256d

This shows the number of users who earned karma for each round. The lower orange line is users with an active vault at the time the .CSV was published.

The number of users with vaults at the time of publishing the data overall averages around 50%. This doesn't indicate that only 50% of the users claim their Moons though as you have 6 months from the distribution to open your vault and claim them.

# Average Moons per user & Average Karma per user

I like an Average

The average Moons earnt per user takes into account a lot of factors: number of users, Moon to karma ratio, the reduction in Moons being released per round and the total karma.

--

My mum is going over details on her cancer surgery, her English is very limited,  while I speak perfect fluent English. I understand that the doctor needs to use a translator (over the phone) when discussing the options with my mum to avoid me lying/influencing my mums choices, my issue is that the translator is saying things wrong/differently from the doctor and some of the points, not saying at all.Examples,  doctor talks about on how they will also remove lymph nodes on top of the mastectomy and the translator says that ""they will also remove the breast skin on top of removing the breast"" (in our language).  Also muddled up all the options for the surgery ( like if my mum wants reconstruction/implants or external prosthetics) to my mum, like the translation made no sense at all and was completely different from what the doctor was saying,  like doc: ""theres 3 options , we can reduce the skin and you will end up with a flat chest on that side, or reconstruction where we can use a silicone implant or a procedure that moves fat from other parts of the body (like belly) to fill in the empty breast skin. Also, because there's calcification near the nipple the radiologist may decide that we may end up not being able to keep the nipple with either option"".  Then the translator says something like "" so there's 2 options, one you keep the nipple the other you don't"" mixed up with a lot of filler to make the doctor believe she said all he said.

like really bad translations. It frustrates me as I then after the consultation have to re-translate myself to my mum and its just creating confusion. What can I do about this? it's the 2nd time we do a consultation and we need to use a translator and both times we got this same woman that cant translate anything right.","NHS translator translating my mum's cancer surgeries options badly, what to do?",2.0,2.0

scwvap,"For those that have some experience with women, it is very common for a man to initiate any form of intimacy. There is almost no condition in which she gives you explicit permission to touch or kiss her . She either responds postively or negatively to a mans initiation- which can be called implicit consent. She may also intitate intimacy but this extreamely rare.

Many men in the public eye seem to get in trouble just by initiation intimate contact without explicit consent. They even get in trouble if it happens in a intimate setting like a hotel room or a bar etc. They get in trouble if its a one-time comment or touch. It often  can still rise to harassment or sexual assault in public opinion.

What im trying to get is that mating practices between men and women are such that explicit consent is almost non exisiting in practice.  When man is trying to get laid and she reponds negatively to his escalating touch or comment, can we considered this harrasment if its a one-time nonrepeating attempt at intimacy

seogt1,"So here‚Äôs a brief backstory. We‚Äôre both college students and we met in class at the beginning of the academic year (September). We dated casually and slept together for a few months, but decided we wanted to make the relationship official around the new year.

For the most part, everything between us has been really great. We communicate well and are generally really understanding of one another and our boundaries. 

One of my boundaries that we seem to disagree on is her going out with her friends to frat parties. To her credit, she doesn‚Äôt go often and if she does, it‚Äôs usually because her friends are dragging her out to them. It‚Äôs not really her scene. 

Now I‚Äôm not much for frat parties myself, but I‚Äôve been to a few. I know what they‚Äôre about, I know what the men are after and I just don‚Äôt like the idea of my girlfriend going out and drinking in an environment like that. I feel like that is really disrespectful to our relationship.  

I‚Äôve expressed this to her more or less as I did above and she doesn‚Äôt see an issue with it. Truth be told, there‚Äôs a bit of insecurity on my part rooted in these feelings. I haven‚Äôt said this to her, but this is a hard boundary in my head. I don‚Äôt care if she went to these parties in the past, I didn‚Äôt care that she did it while we were seeing each other casually, and I wouldn‚Äôt care if she did it after our relationship has run its course. But my feeling is pretty strong that I wouldn‚Äôt want to continue our relationship if she isn‚Äôt respectful of that boundary while we are an item. 

Taking a step back, I feel like it‚Äôs giving her an ultimatum on her personal choices and I don‚Äôt like that. I don‚Äôt like that a part of my reasoning is rooted in my own insecurity. So strangers of the internet, please tell me if I‚Äôm being a jackass and need to drop the this whole thing before I end an otherwise healthy relationship. 

If I‚Äôm not being a jackass about this, what‚Äôs the best way to bring this up to her one last time and tell her that it‚Äôs a dealbreaker for me and I won‚Äôt be interested in continuing the relationship if she doesn‚Äôt agree?",Am I (m20) being controlling with my girlfriend (f19)?,2.0,2.0

A lot of people have asked me on this so I figured I put it all here. When you look at my body, I want you to know that this body has been raped, multiple times. Feel free to fetishize it. I definitely do, to this day. Wish I didn't though, but I can't ever help it.

My rape fetish stemmed from a period of time in my life where my uncle raped me since I was 15 to 17+, never with consent. I was a timid girl, afraid of conflict, and often letting others make decisions for me, and he took advantage of it in restrospect. Having that happened to me made me more timid than I already was, dropped my self esteem to zero and made me depressed for a while. My parents were often not at home at day time, and would only be home at late night. The first time he raped me in an afternoon, he did it on pure impulse, blaming me for going braless at home even though my tits got bigger, said I was teasing and enticing him for so long, said I was too cute and irrisistable.

He pushed my face down on the pillow, on my knees with my hips up high facing him, not looking at my face probably makes him feel less guilty, I figured later, since that's how he'd always take me later on. He was hesitant at first, but plunged in hard anyway, making me scream in my pillow. He leaned his sweaty, huge body over me from behind, and hugged me tight from behind, fingering and teasing my chest. Whenever I tried to crawl or struggle off, he'd wrap his arms tight around my body and not let me. It hurt so much I couldn't do anything but whimper and cry to my pillow while he fucks me from behind

His cock was bigger than average, and it hurt a lot getting my virginity forcibly taken, especially when he wasn't being gentle at all. It was the worst kind of sex I could ever had. Ironically, when he fucked me the same way later on in my life, it felt amazing, and the pain from him being rough turned me on even more. He apologized to me profusely after that for hours, apologizing and agreeing to compensate me by buying me stuff. I was hurt, but I kept quiet anyway, not knowing what else to do nor have the courage to at the time.

Soon after a month, he did it again, and after he realize I was too afraid to say anything about it, it became a regular thing. It went on for years and became part of my life, until in a year's time he gotten better at it, I long stopped crying about it, my body gotten more used to it, I started cumming to the rape, and he knew it. About once a week, when I came back from class, he'd be waiting at home, standing up as soon as I head to the shower, following close behind me. He wouldn't let me close the bathroom door, would watch me take a shower, while he slowly stripped. He'd suddenly lean up close to me and groped my breasts, pressing his hard-on close against my rear before fucking me against the wall right there and then. Sometimes that will be it, sometimes he had a bad week, and decides to release his stress on me by fucking me thoroughly in my own bed after laying a huge towel beneath. In times like those, he'd often be raping me multiple times in that week. He even got me on birth control for a period of time.

For him, he was just using you as a fucktoy, for me, it changed my life, forever. He's imprinted on me sexually, even after counselling and getting over it, he is the reason everytime I touch myself, rough rape is all I ever think about. He groped my tits so often, and so much during sex, that being raped sprung up to my mind whenever another man gropes my tits, I get wet easily. When I got drunk raped by two man in college, I barely cried, and cummed really hard as they both took turns on me. They liked me so much, they went another round on me again the next day morning to afternoon.

I think this could be quite a good policy which would appeal to older generations and would be a stronger indication of patriotism than the flag shagging (which I totally get Starmer has to do, it's just abit annoying). Specifically though I'm talking about a version of national service which isn't really about the military but mainly other things.

The way it would work is either it would be a year or 6 months between school and sixth form, or it could come after sixth form. It would involve doing a designated job but you'd get a 'stipend' (potentially means tested, like a maintanence grant at uni not that they exist any more) for that work - and the work would have to be of some national and community service. Options could include support in the care sector, education, health, military or other specific options like being a court usher or supporting council services for instance.

The benefits would be:

\- Reduce pressure and give support to those sectors

\- Create a sense of social duty and patriotism (the good kind)

\- Help young people from communities which are not well integrated to have the option of different life experiences\*

\- Educate young people with good life experience but also a strong specific knowledge about the area in which they work (eg court ushers will come away with a much stronger knowledge of our legal system)

and one side effect bonus:

\- In the future, every one of the 650 MPs in parliament would have worked at least 6 months in another job and will have insight into that area.

Anyway just posting this for discussion - would love to hear peoples thoughts!

&#x200B;

\* This is a big one so I want to expand - I'm talking about how young people particularly from more conservative families eg those who send their children to single sex schools, or from strict religious backgrounds (particularly Muslim and Jewish but also Catholic too) may not get the chance to socialise and meet people of other sexes/genders/faiths/sexualities/backgrounds and this could be a way of ensuring the get that *choice* . To be clear, I'm not talking about forcing people to live a life they don't want to, but it would be about the choice for young people that may have been denied it by their family.","What do people think about the policy of reinstating national service, but with a quite different meaning...

rye0qg,"I still can't get over that fact. It's happened before in books, movies and tv series. But I'd call those... I dunno? Mild temporary crushes? In this game, I've actually fallen for a digital character that doesn't truly exist and I can't get over it. I feel so fucking silly, but it is the truth.

When I try different playthroughs, I find myself putting a ton of effort to ignore that specific character otherwise I just end up replaying the same damn line over and over again. So silly!

And that brings me to my next point...

I'm sure most here agree that Being A DIK is the best AVN out there, but that's honestly not saying much as most of the AVN games are utter complete garbage. And that's the thing, being a great AVN doesn't do it justice. There are other great AVNs (very few... sigh) , but BaD isn't just a great AVN, or a great videogame.  It's an amazing experience regardless of the medium.

DrPinkCake is simply a brilliant storyteller. He's a very rare talent and I hope BaD players realize it. 

My only wish for this game is a team expansion (something he is against, apparently) so that we can all enjoy bi-monthly episodes instead of bi-yearly ones. It's the only issue with his current business model. I tend to forget about the game because the release pace is way too slow. He shouldn't let his readers forget about him, even if it's temporary. Also, game design-wise, BaD is very lacking. The mini games are not very fun. A game designer would certainly help future content.

Hell, this franchise could become an actual porn empire. Multiple Videogames, novels, TV series, movies... It's unfortunate that he lacks that ambition. Almost a wasted talent.

I know it works for him and he's likely making bank on Patreon and Steam. Good for him! But his business model is not efficient.

Regardless, I'm in awe of DrPinkCake. He got me to take out tissues for something else than a fap in Acting Lessons and now he's stealing my literal heart with his romantic brilliance when all I had originally planned to do was to fuck as many HOTs as possible.

If he ever changes his mind and expands, I'll be first to apply for a job.","Bravo DrPinkCake, I fell in love with a fucking digital character...",2.0,1.0

(looking at you Azura)

They are cruel and again morally evil or amoral things who only care about what they get from their followers rather than wanting to truly be of help.

Yet many see them as the better choice than the Tribunal gods (which I will admit that i am very bias and adore the Tribunal and their lore, especially Almalexia and Sotha Sil, though I will be honest and say i hate Vivec just as much as the Daedra because of all the degenerate gross stuff around him.)

The Tribunal may or may not have taken power by wrongful means, but since it was a dragon break moment i side more with the theory that Nerevar died from Dagoth Ur murdering him instead, either way after they ascended to godhood they have helped Morrowind and the Dunmer because they actually gave a damn and while yes they were flawed overall i feel as though they were a much better influence for the Dunmer than the 3 ""good Daedra"".

I mean Mephala main thing is lust and deceit, Boethiah trickery and destruction and Azura out of jealous rage cursed ALL DUNMER, not exactly very compassionate for a prince who was see as the nicest. Not sure if its in the lore but i read somewhere she had a bet with Sheogorath to see if her priestess could not go mad if Sheogorath mess with her, that is just straight messed up to use a loyal follower just for some stupid bet.

After the Tribunal fell nothing good has happened for the Dunmer, not in the same way at least when the Tribunal were in power and in my opinion Sotha Sil was 100% right in wanting to destroy them.

Small thing to add is Almalexia is a good character and the hate she gets is undeserved, to put it in context, imagine being a literal deity for 3000+ years who cares deeply about her people to the point where she wanted to be the one solving their problems to then slowly loosing that ability to defend both her people and land from invasion and similar things.

I think would drive anyone mad since I feel her madness was less a power grab thing rather she didn't want to loose that ability to be relied upon by her people and still wanted to remain as their ""Mother Of Mercy"" and in her madness misunderstood her actions as good rather than desperate and wrong.",My honest opinion on the Daedra and the Tribunal.

I know this could be dangerous but I love the freedom of not having to worry , everyone is just having fun and If someone takes things too far, I've seen bouncers and other people in the club step up and help /protect the could of been victims ( I myself have never felt afraid) the best part is sometimes I could basically be having sex with my clothes on on the dance floor and never say a word to the person I'm dancing with/on and just be a fantasy. Just leave like that. I never go for sex or kissing or anything like that but I don't mind a bit of pawing . I just don't see why this behavior gets me called a slut or whore.  I don't see why this is looked down upon. Also what's wrong with wanting attention sometimes. I have always hated the term ""attention whore/seeker "" as if needing attention is a bad thing.

ruax8l,"I became a dad a year ago. My daughter wears an article of clothing called a ‚Äúonesie‚Äù nearly every day. Today, my wife decided that since she‚Äôs a (very mobile) toddler now, keeping her in onesies is more trouble than it‚Äôs worth.

That‚Äôs all well and good, but what about me? I would like some onesies for myself!

Prior to becoming a dad, I thought that ‚Äúonesies‚Äù were those one-piece pajama suits, sometimes with feet, but those are really ‚Äúunion suits‚Äù and nothing like what babies wear. 

Onesies are actually basically a t-shirt (long- or short-sleeved) with a extra material and snap buttons at the bottom so you can snap them together at the crotch.

I‚Äôm 6‚Äô4‚Äù 280 lbs‚Äîa tall guy with a gut. And my height mostly comes from my torso. So as you can imagine, my t-shirts become untucked all the time!

What I wouldn‚Äôt give to have a wardrobe full of t-shirts that securely snap at my crotch! And as long as I‚Äôm wishing they would feature my favorite band names, pop culture and fantasy art like my current t-shirts!

Why can‚Äôt we live in a world where merch tables and apparel stores are stacked with adult-sized onesies with fun colors and prints so that the tall and husky among us who wear heavy belts and keep all our stuff in our pants pockets can move about this world feeling secure that they can get through the day without showing the world their gut or butt crack?

My wife think I‚Äôm nuts, and says that in a world of adult onesies, they still wouldn‚Äôt come in sizes for long-torsoed people. But I believe you could get them in long sizes, like dress shirts. Also, I like the idea of onesie dress shirts. Also, this is my dream world and I get to say what it‚Äôs like!

I‚Äôm not holding my breath, but a man can dream.

s9p6i1,"After seeing the Uber girl post and then the follow up post pointing out the misogyny in the comments, I just wanted to put this out there. That story was not directly related to sex work but seeing some of the misogynistic views some hear may hold, I feel this should be said. 

Sex work is work and we stand with workers. 

Whatever reasons they may have for choosing that path it is not our place to judge. From my understanding this sub was dedicated to fighting for the rights of all workers and fighting to prevent the exploitation of said workers.


Edit: Just wanted to say thank you to the people that's showed love on this honestly wasn't sure how it would be received and the people that were generally interested In having a conversation about this, y'all are awesome 

There are two groups of detractors that I want to address before turning in for the night

The first being people that are comparing sex work to trafficking or other heinous crimes. Your gross plan and simple,  fix yourselves.

The other more frequent criticism was people saying that this type of talk divides the movement. All I have to say is, If a movement cannot withstand criticism critiques of itself from its members then it's not a movement it's cult like groupthink. The idea that someone advocating for this group to be more inclusive is somehow divisive is complete nonsense

Edit 2: All right guys I'll give you the title was pretty dumb. Should have been more along the lines of being ""pro-worker is being pro-sex worker"" or something

Edit 3: thank you u/riaskies. You said what I was trying to convey in a much more eloquent way than ever I could. This got out of hand overnight, I'm not going to be responding to anymore. people can assume what they want about me, I really don't care.

dkiarj,"TL; DR at bottom 

When my husband went on his first deployment: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, you‚Äôll be with him forever in heaven!‚Äù 

 I miscarried my 1st baby after previously finding out that I have a condition that can cause infertility issues. 
SIL: ‚ÄúWell, if you weren‚Äôt such a selfish and ungodly wife this wouldn‚Äôt have happened.‚Äù 

She announced she was pregnant 3 days before what would have been my due date for the baby I lost. I confronted her and told her she could have waited or just not told my husband and I because we‚Äôre still grieving. 
SIL: ‚ÄúUGH just get over it already and BE HAPPY FOR ME!‚Äù

I miscarried before I could find out the sex of the baby, husband and I had a boy & a girl name picked out and (regrettably) told family what they were as part as our grieving process. Halfway through her pregnancy, SIL finds out she‚Äôs having a boy and announced it to everyone. She had picked the name that we had for our baby. I confronted her about it.
SIL: ‚ÄúWell it‚Äôs not like you‚Äôre going to use it. You can‚Äôt just claim names, especially since you don‚Äôt even have a baby to show for it.‚Äù

After finding out I was pregnant again, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre going to have to figure out what you‚Äôre going to do if it‚Äôs a boy. You‚Äôre not going to circumcise him because thats mutilation! You wouldn‚Äôt mutilate a girl would you!?‚Äù

*context: she‚Äôs crazy religious, the kind that makes real Christians look bad and feels the need to mention it in every conversation:
‚ÄúReally though, circumcision isn‚Äôt even biblical!‚Äù

While talking about music, ‚ÄúMY kids ONLY listen to Christian music because that‚Äôs the only music kids should ever listen to to be happy!‚Äù 

When we were sharing a cabin and my 4 month old went to sleep upstairs and I‚Äôm trying to listen for him downstairs, her kids (8 & 2) are screaming bloody murder on the stairs and wrestling. She doesn‚Äôt discipline her kids and they have no structure.
Me: Can you tell your kids to keep it down? My baby is sleeping.
SIL: ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not even being loud, and if you don‚Äôt like how my kids behave then you can leave.‚Äù *it was 9 pm and we had just driven 5 hours to get there. 

Her two year old shoved a tiny toy in my 4 month old‚Äôs mouth and when I quickly pulled it out she says while laughing, ‚Äúlook how sweet! My kid is sharing!‚Äù 

Telling my in laws, and my husband that her 8 year old NEEDS to hold my 4 month old for a picture, her 8 year old has said and done some alarming things in the past, so I have my reasons for saying no. While I‚Äôm in a room with my baby, who is sleeping, hearing through the door, 
SIL‚Äôs 8 year old: ‚ÄúI wanna hold the baby!‚Äù 
SIL: ‚ÄúOP said no but her husband said to ask her, I think the baby is in his pack n play, just go get him.‚Äù
SIL‚Äôs 2 year old proceeds to barge into our room without knocking and then stops wide eyed when he sees me. 
SIL coming up behind him: ‚Äúoh! I didn‚Äôt know you were in here.. my kids want to play with their cousin!‚Äù 
Me: You need to knock before you come into a room and baby is sleeping, and I said no. Get out.‚Äù 
SIL: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to be rude. Just wake him up. He shouldn‚Äôt be sleeping during family time anyway.‚Äù
Me: OUT! 
SIL makes obnoxious annoyed noise and says to her kids while herding them out: ‚ÄúWhen it‚Äôs FAMILY time, everyone should be awake!‚Äù

While having a conversation with her 8 year old about seeing a video about a little girl her age cutting her hair and donating it to her friend with cancer so she can have hair too. I ask her if she would ever do that for a sick friend that she loves? 
8 year old: ‚ÄúNO BECAUSE SICK PEOPLE ARE DISGUSTING!‚Äù 
Alarmed, I look at SIL, who is laughing. 
SIL: ‚ÄúWhen my husband is sick, I plug my nose and say ‚ÄòEW! Sick people are gross!‚Äù 

TL; DR: Some of the awful things my SIL has said. I‚Äôll post more in other posts.

* Edit: My husband and I keep away from SIL & BIL as much as we can, again this is what has been said over years of having to deal with her. Unfortunately it‚Äôs easier said than done to completely keep her out of our lives because we are close to other people in the family. It feels like the best we can do at this point is have a strong backbone. Some of the extended family think she is just stupid and doesn‚Äôt pick up on social cues, I agree but also feel like that‚Äôs an excuse for her to get away with BS. Talking it out is therapeutic for me.",Bullshit justnoSIL has said to me in the last 8 years,2.0,2.0

I received a message from someone recently, asking about humiliation. Specifically, about being on the receiving end. I can answer in theory, but as I'm never likely to be the one in that position, I thought I'd throw it open to some of you lovely people, who are. 

I'm sure most of you know my views on asking questions of one section of our community. So these questions are open to everyone. 

*It's hard for me to imagine feeling totally comfortable and humiliated at the same time... people who feel that way, does that just come naturally?*

*As soon as they realize they like humiliation, they are totally confident and self-assured in it? No working up to it sometimes?*

*If someone has strong desires toward humiliation but doesn't yet feel totally comfortable with it, do they mean they shouldn't ever try anything until that changes?*

*I feel like something feels humiliating because it feels shameful/embarrassing. So how does that happen at the same time as feeling completely confident and happy about whatever is intended to be humiliating?*",How Do You Do What You Do?,2.0,2.0

I've been turned away from establishments by security guards, questioned and documented by the police for literally nothing, shouted abuse in the street, people run away from me, people see me and instantly cover their faces, everyone stares at me, I have students say nationalistic and derogatory things in my classes at such young ages (not that any age is ok, but it means they're being brainwashed early), I've had taxis pull up, notice I'm a foreigner and then pull away, Security have turned me away from districts, communities, KTV, commercial buildings, and I just get to watch natives go into these places witout issue.

so much! 

same with sh jokes

I think if your struggling u to try it.
something abt not putting it in words makes me feel like my only option isn't to do it

i started replacing it with sarcastic confident comments n trained my self worth! sarcastic confidence is 100 times better than self deprecation i promise

also getting rid of the ""I'm not gonna make it past 18"" mentality just made me feel so much better

I had a lot of friends who made jokes constantly about how much they hated themselves and things that i previously mentioned and i separated myself from them for my mental health.


Now this is just some thoughts but ppl who have ""dark humor"" ab their issues tend to only stick themselves in loops w their issues bc they're constantly thinking ab it and ""making jokes"" but after it's been repeated enough times jokes arent jokes anymore.

Ben/Jasmin: Both batshit insane and neglect their children. And I wouldn't mind if Jasmin set Ben on fire.


Gino/Alina: They're basic bitches who want sex before deciding on a relationship status. They can each wear their hat and shoes to bed, respectively.


Kimbaaaly/Hamza: She wants a hot young thing who's naive about sex, he wants someone to baby him and buy him toys. On a more serious note, Kim just might be persuasive enough to instill a work ethic in Hamza.


Ella/Usman: He likes big white American women with disposable incomes, and she's at least closer to him in age. Just tell Ella that Usman lives only a boat ride away from Western Asia and that he's trying to be a J-pop idol.


Johnny/Ximena: Breaking the mold here by pairing two non-US citizens. They both put their families first and want the best for their kids. You know the boys would get along splendidly. Also, if Johnny really is into the cowboy western fantasy, remind him that the US isn't the only American country with a historical cattle ranch culture.


Mike/Mahogany: Of course we don't really know much about Mahogany yet or if she's being scammed herself, but I'd much rather see Mike get catfished than make him go out of his way to be hurt in person.


So that means we're left with Caleb and Memphis. Who, according to the arbitrary rules I made up, can't be paired off together. Instead I propose....


Caleb/Hamza's sister: Assuming she's single, they both seem like well-traveled, well-educated people. And out of everyone who's eligible this season, they're the only ones with a shred of common sense. Hamza can always beat the shit out of Caleb if necessary.


Memphis/Elijah: They're both creepy sex fiends with manipulative behavior and Memphis isn't too far off from what Elijah deals with from Alina anyway. Besides, we all know Memphis needs a Gay Best Friend, not a husband.",90F: B490: S3: Partner Swap Edition,2.0,2.0

I created this account to visit one new country/city/state subreddit each day to just ask, what's up? What's going on where you live? How's life like, what good or bad thing just happened, new music, cultural phenomenons, really anything goes. Open ended discussions are welcome, as are random facts about your country's national bird or what you had for dinner today! 

My goal here is to simply broaden my horizons. By this time next year, i hope to be able to look at any country and know just a little bit more about it than i do now, and have just a slightly better understanding of what life is actually like in places other than my own.

I'll start with the country closest to mine and work my way out. Today ~~I'm visiting~~ trying to visit r/England, but that sub is long dead so I'm here instead. So, what's up?

If you'd like to join me on my journey, just click my profile and go read the comments from the other subs I've been to. Maybe you too can learn just slightly more about the world around you.

why not have that quest involve the railroad? it could be a really intresting situation as not only did you not co-operate with the railroad, they should be pissed you went in and ruined there ""sneaky"" operation (like it was actually gonna produce fruit), leading to a situation where you need what the railroad has, but the railroad is too mad to give it, possibely either leading to

1) a stale mate between the two, neither side budges and you might need to turn to the brotherhood  
2) outright hostile actions, leading to a battle between the remnants of the railroad and the minutemen, leaving the minutemen with there tech but not expertise, leading to a longer process for decrypting the data.  
3) a deal, we scratch their back good they scratch ours, possibly leading to a joint railroad-minutemen operation against the brotherhood base in the police station, as (my) minutemen should be hostile to a new entity try to ""restore order"" to the commonwealth and shoving its nose in my nations territory.

r93r9v,"Because I am a Disney shill and total fanboy I went to see Encanto. It was....flawed. I feel like this film is at a disadvantage because it's going to be compared to Moana and Coco because of similar story beats, shared creative members and overall cultural importance. However Moana was the closest Disney has gotten to an epic with it's oceans spanning Odyssey-esque story. Coco was a sprawling adventure through the underworld. Both of those films had a sense of scope that let the overall basic stories they were telling feel much more grandiose. Encanto isn't that. In fact, Encanto feels more like a play than anything else. Most of the story takes place in one general setting. The magic is more related to personal strengths and failings. The fantastical adventure scenes are more metaphorical and represent inner turmoil. This is actually somewhat new for Disney. However it's also one of the movie's flaws while at the same time it's strength. The concept itself is sound but it's execution in part is lacking and it's because all of what I mentioned takes place in some of the musical sequences. 

I like Lin Manuel Miranda. I'm not a fanboy but I'm also not a hater. Moana remains his strongest work simply because there was someone else to rein in his bad habits. There was way too much fast talking that he likes to pass off as rapping in this film. I refuse to call it actual rapping because at times the flow was messier than a season of Real Housewives of Miami. There were times I couldn't even make out what they were saying. I had to lookup the lyrics to a couple songs to know what was being said. Cast actual rappers to perform/write the rapping segments of your music Lin. I promise you it will be so much better. When In The Heights came out in 2007, his style was a breath of fresh air. By this point, it's become stale. Luisa popping and locking to, what I'll generously call a Reggaeton song, took me out of the movie. 

Musicals work best when it feels like the music is a natural extension of the characters' emotions that they cannot express in words. When singing is no longer enough, they must dance. That progression isn't just some old timey tradition. It's a proven formula to help communicate the gradual progression of emotion. There are songs in this film that really mess with the flow because in these songs it feels like some dialogue was cut that would lead into the characters singing. Proper integration of your songs is key to making sure your musical doesn't feel like a parody of itself. For example, when Isabella and Mirabel have their confrontation the song interrupts the actual emotion of the scene. Isabella starts singing about how she feels so much pressure to be perfect. That's fine as a concept but I think there needed to be more that lead into the song. Here's an example:

Isabella: What....is....this?

Mirabel: I thought you could only make flowers. 

Isabella: I've only ever been told to make flowers. Abeula wants things perfect. What's more perfect than a rose?

Mirabel: Flowers are beautiful. But....they're not everything. Flowers wither and die. You find yourself in a vicious cycle to keep making more and more until....

Isabella: It's all I am. 

Mirabel: Is that what you think you are? Just beauty?

Isabella: What else is there?

Mirabel: Maybe you could find out. 

Then you lead to a sequence of Isabella making all kinds of weird shit. You then reframe the song as Mirabel pushing Isabella to push herself. However in the movie proper, Isabella essentially tells us what's wrong with her, identifies the solution and then enacts that solution with Mirabel basically acting as backup. Letting Mirabel be the emotional lead in this sequence would have been so much more impactful. Because now you have her guiding her sister down the right path. It also strengthens her character and emphasizes her role as the one who can heal the cracks. Why not let her also be the one to realize Isabella doesn't actually want to marry CGI Maluma? Maybe Mirabel could see what no one else could, which is where I thought they were going with that. There's a lot emphasis on eyes and Mirabel is the only one with glasses. It's implied that's what's going on but I feel it could have been more explicit. 

At times the music in this film feels like an obligation rather than an extension of what the characters wish to express. Honestly this almost would've been stronger without the songs. Lin doesn't get an Oscar nomination that way but the non singing portions of the movie almost feel like a different film. Almost everything with Alma and Mirabel feels like a tense family drama. The songs intrude on nearly every real moment the film is going for. Luisa's song is a great example. For one, it doesn't need to exist. You could easily just have her do something like: 

Luisa: I'm fine. Everything's fine. I've gotta get the donkeys. The church needs realignment. I've gotta do *so much* before this proposal so I really don't have time to--

Mirabel: Luisa do you need to talk?

Luisa: I don't know anything about the magic fading and--

Mirabel: Then don't talk about that. Tell me what's going on with you. Delores heard your eye twitch. Is something on your mind?

Luisa: Huh....

Mirabel: What's wrong?

Luisa: No one ever asked me that before. 

This could lead to a conversation about how she doesn't feel strong enough to handle every single thing falling down around her and she wishes that her gift was something else. She's tired and she wants a break but if she expresses that she knows she'll let Abuela down. You can then have the in canon ending of Mirabel hugging her and letting her know it's alright. But her song brings the movie to a screeching halt. It has almost no relation style wise to any other song. The sequences are even more cartoonish than anything else in the film. It feels like the Latina version of A Friend Like Me. It feels out of place. The integration is also a bit sloppy and for a minute I was waiting for Mirabel to ask 'why are you singing?' I should not be thinking about whether or not the characters are actually singing unless I'm watching Monty Python's Holy Grail. The natural progression from talking to singing doesn't work for a good chunk of the musical numbers. The movie just stops so the characters can have a number except for three of them and I'll get to those. 

A good example of how to do is the Under the Sea from The Little Mermaid. Sebastian is speaking but when his words no longer work he sings. But during that speaking the music for the song starts to play under him hinting at the progression. We not only see that words fail but we hear it as well. The song isn't born simply of us needing a song here. It's born of Sebastian's frustration at not getting through to Ariel. Luisa's song kinda does that but there's no a clear enough line from when her words no longer get the job done to when she needs to sing. The music should have been moved up to earlier in their interaction to smooth this out. 

YouTuber Sideways has a great video on Disney's Tarzan and why the music in that film does the most a disservice. I'll link it here but to sum it up, because the songs are sung at us by some disembodied narrator and not by the characters themselves there is a disconnect of emotion. The musical sequences feel more like music videos rather than an expression of anything the characters are thinking or feeling. He also made another video about how Disney uses language and details how they evolved from using non English languages as cultural flourishes, to using them being sung onscreen by the people of that culture to make a narrative point. So with all that said, Encanto feels like a step backwards. 

The emotional lynchpin on the film Dos Orgulitas is sung at us by some unseen voice. But it's also the only other song besides the title track sung entirely in Spanish. I understand this is meant for a largely English speaking audience but again it feels like a drawback. In Moana, half of a song is sung in a Polynesian language. Coco had many songs that Incorporated Spanish and the climax of the film was a song sung in Spanish. So with all that said, why not have Alma actually sing Dos Orgulitas? You could even keep it in Spanish. But by not having her sing it creates a distance between the audience and her emotionally. Imagine if Let It Go were sung by an offscreen voice while Elsa sealed herself away from the world. Or if Part of Your World, Almost There, Reflections, I Am Moana or Remember Me had sequences where we didn't see the characters singing. Even if the issue is having a character on screen sing in Spanish the whole time you could have worked in lyrics so she is expressing herself less ambiguously. Hell the lyrics as is work well enough in English that you could have her sing it. But having the most narratively important song sung at us instead of to us, doesn't work for me.

Waiting for a Miracle, We Don't Talk About Bruno and The Family Madrigal work pretty well in terms of function. Mi Encanto, Colombia is fun but mostly serves as a transition track. It's not communicating anything narratively and plays over scenes where characters are mostly just doing things like having a party. It's fine, no complaints. The Family Madrigal and We Don't Talk About Bruno are the best numbers in the show. The former because there's so much build up between when the music starts and when the lyrics kick in. The singing feels like a natural extension of what Mirabel is trying to do, which is explain her family. It also could not be done simply through words. With Surface Pressure and What Else Can I Do, dialogue would have actually worked better for most of that. We Don't Talk About Bruno is born from Pepa's frustration that Mirabel is digging into matters she shouldn't. Words fail and she must sing. Waiting on a Miracle is successful in part for the same reason but I do have one big issue with it. 

Stephanie Beatriz gives Mirabel a lot of spunk and character. But her singing isn't great and that almost works in a way. Her character is 'average' so it makes sense she's just an okay singer. However her big ballad doesn't really resonate with me for that same reason. It's written for a much bigger voice than she actually has. There's a point in the song where the music indicates this where she needs to belt. It crescendos but she does not. She mostly stays at the same octave most of the song. This is supposed to be her Reflection, her How Far I'll Go, her Part of Your World. But because Stephanie physically cannot sing on par with Jodi Benson or Lea Salonga, and to be fair few people can, the song doesn't quite land on it's own. They should have used another actress as her singing voice. Great singers know how to make themselves sound average. For an interesting example, see Jason Alexander singing 'Believe It or Not, I'm Not Home'. What pushes Waiting on a Miracle into being a great sequence is the staging. 

Integration and thematic cohesion aside, Encanto has hands down the most creative, energetic and dynamic musical sequences I've seen in a musical in a very, very long time. I'm not even just talking animated musicals. This shit is on par with Chicago in it's staging. I listened to the soundtrack before I saw the movie and thought 'this is cute'. Then I saw the movie and was blown away by some of the things they did here. We Don't Talk About Bruno feels like a rollercoaster of a song. It functions both as a villain song of sorts, think Cruella De Vil, but also as a really good ensemble number. Each character gets a moment to shine and use their powers in creative ways. The movement is so fluid and the lighting is excellent. The transitions from each verse is signified by different dancing styles, lighting and camera angles. It's an explosive number that is almost dizzying and the camerawork is integral to communicating this. I felt as overwhelmed as Mirabel did.

Speaking of movement, Disney really captured the magic of dance with Encanto. Dancing in animation has always been hit or miss. It can either be great or feel like something meant for a meme. Outside of Surface Pressure, most of the musical sequences have excellent choreography. The movement is so fluid and each character feels incredibly vibrant and lived in. The character animation is great, the character work not so much. Outside of Mirabel, Almo, Bruno and a few others most of the family is relegated to being side characters who are largely used for sight gags. Pepa, Camilo, Felix, Mirabel's parents and to a lesser degree Antonio aren't super pivotal to the narrative. They're in it a lot and they're mostly entertaining but Mirabel barely interacts with most of them outside of a song or a talk here or there. You could have easily written half of them out of the plot and not skipped a beat. Even Luisa is shunted off to the side after her big number. When Bruno has his vision about Mirabel needing to reconcile with Isabella I kind of laughed. Yes this character who we have heard maybe ten lines from who they barely hinted at having any layers is now pivotal to the plot. As much as I enjoyed her musical number, I wasn't particularly emotionally invested because we just spent an hour and some change with Colombian Regina George and they're just now bothering to give her some depth. Also there's no apology on her end for treating her younger sister like an interloper the bulk of the movie. She basically has her epiphany on her own, randomly thanks Mirabel for it despite her not really doing much and now we gotta fight with grandma. 

Speaking of which, I would like Disney to go back to writing actual villains again. A large part of why Coco worked was because there was an antagonist that embodied the opposite of the themes the movie was trying to preach. Ernesto de la Cruz was a man who eschewed any meaningful relationships in his life in pursuit of fame and glory. Him being revealed as a monster allowed Miguel to realize the role model he had been looking for was in the humble man in front of him all along. By having something to fight against, it allowed the members of the family who weren't on the best terms to find something to fight against and realize the pettiness of their divide. Having an antagonist, spurred along character development for Miguel and Imelda. 

Encanto needed a flesh and bone villain that would give the other characters a reason to work together and play off each other. The magic being lost and the house crumbling should have been the climax of the second act. Then the family is working against whatever threat for the rest of the film. Since it's heavily implied the magic comes from something outside of the candle, why not get creative with that? As the characters are trying to stop the threat they do things they wouldn't normally do when they had powers and in doing so they get those powers back. Therefore showing that the magic was in the family themselves and not inherent to just a spell or whatever it was. In fact the best part for me, was the various characters using their powers to get the candle. On that note, the rules of the magic didn't make a ton of sense. Yes I know it's essentially a fairy tale but usually in these movies we get some kind of rules or parameters. Kiss the prince or become a sea urchin. Find true love before the petal falls or you're a beast forever. Touch the spindle and you go to sleep until true love's kiss wakes you up etc etc. Here we don't really get that and that would be fine if so much emphasis wasn't put on preserving the magic or getting it back. 

Lastly, the animation itself is obviously very beautiful and well done but that's not really enough for me anymore. Disney has proven they can create gorgeous animated films but the stories have been weak. Moana and Zootopia stand out as being stronger but Big Hero 6, Ralph Wrecks the Internet, Raya, Frozen 2 and now Encanto show an over reliance on medium and not enough focus on using the medium to tell a strong story. Spiderverse stands out as a recent animated film that used its medium in service to the story it was telling. Encanto almost didn't even need to be animated. I hate to keep going back to much better films, but Moana and Coco were explorations of culture and identity through a hyper stylized method. You could not do either of those in live action. Magical powers aside so much of Encanto is grounded in reality they could have just shot this in live action. Perhaps that would have forced them to focus on the story instead, who knows. As is I'd give this film a 5 or 6/10.

Apparently some kid just got suspended for a week because he called a girl fat in a text to one of her friends, who then reported it to the principal. The entire school is going to have an assembly about bullying today.

It immediately reminded me of when I was in elementary school and I made a girl cry after literally weeks of calling her fat on the bus. All that came of it was her mom calling my mom, and my mom reprimanding me for a few hours. I learned my lesson and we even ended up becoming friends afterwards.

That's probably a bad example of what I'm getting at, but it seems absurd to me that a kid could be suspended for being rude over a text (that wasn't even intended to reach the person he was being rude to in the first place). It got me thinkin' about the ""some of y'all weren't bullied enough"" meme and the potential implications that a world without bullying could have, and possibly has had, on today's youth. 

Do you think there are any elements of today's youth culture that are a direct result of kids not getting picked on enough?

s7f96a,"A friend of a friend recommended I contact this development executive who they had an already established relationship with at an indie production company to send my script. It's a low budget genre, the kind of stuff they're specifically looking for.

The executive emailed me back and told me they read my IMDb profile (which has my birth date on it), and said if it weren't for my age, the would have agreed to read my script. Being in my early 40's, I was told that it's a hindrance in today's marketplace, simply because it's more than likely my writing is akin to an older market and generation to which they're not focusing on, as they aiming for the 20-30 demographic. All these without reading a word of the script or log line itself.

I know age bias existed in this business, but not so blatantly upfront about it like this person was.

EDIT (1/19) - This really blew up. Thanks to everyone for the kind and helpful comments. As sucky as it may be right now in the industry, it's nice to know I'm not alone in this maniacal business and the age bias/woke/cancel culture is affecting so many of us.

In regards to removing my age off of IMDb, believe me, I've tried. I've been an IMDb member since 1999, and never thought posting my age would come back to bite me in the butt. When I joined IMDbPro, IMDb went ahead and took my middle name from my credit card information, and added that into my profile without asking. That took me years of me hounding them to remove it, until the finally did. IMDb is other nightmare in itself. Unfortunately removing it is easier said than done. Actors and SAG have been fighting IMDb on this very thing for well over a decade now.

sh0up6,"I've been enjoying the following 32-heat pact recently with the rail and fists:

* Hard Labor 5
* Lasting Consequences 4
* Extreme Measures 3
* Benefits Package 2
* Middle Management
* Underworld Customs
* Damage Control 2
* Tight Deadline 3.

Nothing in the pact except Underworld Customs affects your ability to build a run. You can buy out shops and have access to Dark Foresight, God's Legacy, and rerolls to become very overpowered. Max Tight Deadline usually isn't a problem due to your DPS and the lack of Jury Summons and Calisthenics Program, and using the rail or fists largely mitigates Damage Control (especially with Zeus boons). Honestly, it feels like you're just speedrunning normally most of the time. 

You never get to heal and enemies deal double damage. However, dodging isn't any harder than usual unless you get a bad Benefits Package combo since there is no Forced Overtime. Enemies tend not to live long enough to hit you, and even bosses melt quickly. Stubborn Defiance is mandatory; it will give you tons of health over the course of a run, especially if you abuse it by dying right at the end of each chamber. Finding Patroclus makes the last portion of the run much easier, especially if you find the Satyr Sack in time for Touch of Styx Dark to last until the final boss. 

Builds that I have enjoyed with this pact are Merciful End Demeter Fists and Zeus attack on Eris or >!Lucifer!< Rail. IMO, this is an easier first 32 heat clear than the Shattered Shackle strategy.","Glass Cannon: A fun, consistent 32 heat build",2.0,2.0

Hi,

Throwaway account for only this question.

Serious answers only.

The incident happened today and 100% true, I need advice.

I am 23M in Pune, and today my entire family was not home in the morning except me, I was in my house due to WFH.  
My maid arrived in the house and realized no one is in my house, I have noticed since a long time that she is a bit touchy.

Today, she asked me to check her weight on my weight machine and blah blah, asked me to check the number since she cant read, my weighing machine is placed in a place where you cant look at it sideways so I looked from behind and while checking she started to use her butt to grind against my groin. (She did this multiple times today)

I was taken a back a little, but I didn't pay any heed at that time, then she started throwing small talks and how she feels ""nice"" touching me, watching porn and stuff (just general seduction talks). So in short, she was trying to seduce me and me being a piece of shit, got seduced. I didn't touch her even when she was provoking me to because I was scared.

She has worked in our house since a long time and doesn't have a husband or kids FYI.

Tbh, the only reason I didn't follow along is because I have 0 experience in all this and I was scared of STD because of no rubber, If I had condoms, I would have 100% gone ahead.  
My real scare would be if I did the act and I come back with a rape/molestation allegation.

After she left, I had my post nut clarity and felt extremely worried and was shaking, what she did was extremely inappropriate and me who did nothing and went along felt even more so.

So, my brain is right now split into 2, ofc there is one side which screams to go with the flow, the other one says its too risky.

Can someone help me with possible legal issues which might appear if I choose to do any of the 2?The entire power play seems to be with her.  
I am really scared that if I reject after showing signs of ""interest"" (which was just my brain being horny), she might put a molestation charge against me. (I swear to god, I have not touched her inappropriately in any way, I am too much of a virgin to do that)  
And if I go ahead with doing ""it"" with her, I might end up being blackmailed for things.

The biggest scare I have is having a false rape charge against me.

Also, please don't call me a shit guy, I already feel disgusted with myself.

Thanks.




*Edit*:

Ok, so I am writing this comment as a Q&A since it turns out to very difficult to reply to each and every one of you, rest assured I have read all your comments. All of this means so much to me you guys have no idea.  


Q: First I feel people are having a hard time understanding how did I get seduced and not touch her?  


A: TLDR: I did not have sex with her.   


Long answer: I did not follow up with any sexual advances she made towards me but I did not push her back either. So while I was getting harassed, I just froze. Hope this clears out a lot of air, also this will sound really pathetic of me when I fess up on this but in my mind at that particular moment, I was half horny (ideal scenario when someone gets seduced) and half scared. I think this is the biggest problem with male mindset, we don't have our post nut clarity all the time, I only realized wtf I did (or did not do, should have pushed her away instantly) AFTER I did the nut which was in the bathroom after she left.  


I have been raised with high moral values and probably the reason I still had some sanity left in that situation.   


Q: Sequence of event  
Event was like this:  

\- Asked to check weight  

\- Grinded her back-side on my groin  

\- Started touching my arms with her arms  

\- Grinded her back-side on my groin again.  

\- Tried to hug me, I froze and couldn't respond  

\- Says how she feels very good when she does this 
 
\- Grinds her groin on my groin, totally feeling me up at this point.  

\- Goes back and talks if I know how to do ""it""  

\- I tell her I do not know how to do ""it""  

\- Tells me I should watch some videos and how she watches videos on her TV  

\- While I was feeding my cats, comes and does the entire sequence of touching me and feeling me up.  

\- Talks about how she sleeps naked etc etc.   

\- Talks borderline romantic and sexual stuff, by this time I am suspecting this is definitely not a hookup call and more towards romantic side of things. Giant red flag.  

\- Finishes her work, informs me and tells me 10 times she is leaving, I said ok  

\- She continues to ask, do I want her to leave  

\- I said yes please  

\- I go to close the door, she again grind herself very hard on me.  

\- Leaves.  


Q: What does harassment feel like?  


A: Terrible, my eyes water whenever I think about it, hands start shaking, it is hard to talk about, and the worst part is, I am not worried about the harassment as much as I am worried about criminal allegations which could be filed against me. Being harassed is bad enough, its even worse when chances of criminal allegations against me are more worrying than that. I am very very scared right now.  


Q: Did I tell anyone?  


A: Yes, I have told my brother everything and borrowed his webcam and hid it under the monitor, I have setup YouCam and will record whenever she is in the house and I will only be sitting in front of my computer. The biggest mistake I did was not turning on my mobile's recorder today. I only plan to tell my parents AFTER I gather enough evidence, things can go down south very quickly if I tell my mother.  


I would first of all like to thank all of you for being so supportive in such a stressful time. I needed some of you talk some rationale into me. I also hope this never happens to anyone, My plan is to record whenever she is in the house and my brother will leave my room and go talk to Dad for a while to open up an opportunity for her to touch me again, I plan to calmly talk to her why is she doing this, this is not morally correct etc. etc.   
I will keep you guys updated with the situation if anything happens, which I am sure will happen.","Got seduced by my maid, wanted to but got scared. Need advice on how to move forward.",2.0,2.0

Kurt Jaimungal showed incredible patience during a (mostly) rambling interview. Every question was greeted with a long-winded and meandering response, which left the listener unable to remember the original question. Still though, Linda has enough material to keep me listening, and enough stories to keep my imagination running. And the interview was MOSTLY entertaining and thought provoking -- even if it was VERY far out there.

She has always been quick to arrogance and defensiveness (in my opinion) -- but I am truly stunned and embarrassed for Linda when listening to the last few minutes of the interview. I think it shows that many of the heavyweights in the community have allowed their egos to overshadow the quest for the truth.

She says she's never heard of CE5 before? I'm pretty sure I've heard interviews of Linda WITH Greer talking about summoning UFOs with CE5. Maybe I'm wrong, but for someone with a supposed photographic memory, it was more then a little awkward that she claimed not to have even HEARD of it before.

Linda -- please learn to roll with the punches -- even when you completely misinterpret a question to be a nonexistent punch. Kurt Jaimungal was not undermining the interview with his final questions -- Linda was undermining her own professionalism and years of experience by becoming hostile, adversarial, and arrogantly defensive for no reason beyond her fragile ego. 

When people don't respect you, how are they supposed to believe you when you make unbelievable claims? During decades of investigations, it seems natural to stumble upon bad information from time to time. In 80 years, it's natural to make personal and professional mistakes from time to time. It's human. Own your mistakes, take responsibility, post a redaction, and move on. 

I hope that other UFO investigators can look at this podcast, and use it as an example of how NOT to act during an interview. Linda Moulton Howe's contributions have not gone unnoticed, but nobody is above scrutiny. A 'holier than thou' attitude does nothing to help bring credibility to the subject of the unexplained.

From where he said they lived to my job was about 30 minutes. So 930, still no show. Call, he says they had to stop to get gas and a bite to eat.

10 hits, and at this point I figure he's just messing with me so I play into it. He never shows up...

About 6 months later, need more help in another job, post an ad, and this same guy responds. I figure, I don't want him on my job but I can mess with him.

I give him an address in the hills and tell him to be there at 8. I fully expect that he finds pull the same crap so I just go about my day. Well about 845 he calls me and is pissed because he was at that house at 8, and no one answered. Then he had to drive back down the hill (about 30 minutes) to get service to call me.

I profusely apologize and tell him that I had to go to the lumber yard, but that I'm on my way back, so go back to the house and I'll be there in about 45 minutes.

2 hours later he calls me cussing me out...

se32i0,"To elaborate: I am talking about the initial meeting and dating phase. Once you are in a more committed relationship this will be an entirely different conversation. I am asking which type of man is *initially* most attractive for a woman who is still single and looking. 

I ask as a follow up to the previous post about [restricted socisexuality](https://www.reddit.com/r/PurplePillDebate/comments/sdo6yb/why_do_men_perceive_women_with_faces_indicating/) which mentions this research: [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1090513808000032?via%3Dihub](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1090513808000032?via%3Dihub)

I have always thought it was common knowledge that women intellectually preferred men who showed maturity, restraint, self-control, and decisiveness. That women saw these traits more in men who showed resistance to feminine wiles. And therefore (somehow) such men were deemed *more valuable* because they show with their behavior that they can be more depended upon.

Since such men can't be easily seduced by other women, his friends, trends, gossip, prejudice, or hearsay he is more able to regulate his own thoughts and feelings totally independently from the usual influences - including your own. It means that such a man will not be putty in your hand. All the usual outside influences will not have any significant sway or power in his own actions or on his decisions/choices within the scope of his relationship with the woman he is dating.

On the flip side you have those men who give women instant attention and are easily swayed, influenced, and lulled over by women's charms. These guys melt in women's hands and have a harder time resisting women's influence over them.

Then of course there is the gigantic spectrum between these two extremes.

On the one hand you have Stoic, Self-controlled, Serious. And on the other you have Neurotic, Passionate, Flighty.

I ask women here for their thoughts on this, just in case I have been way off all these years.","Question for Women: Would you prefer a man who is likely to resist and taper your advances and feminine wiles, because he is self-restrained and serious minded, or would you prefer a man who easily and eagerly gives you his full attention every time you throw your charms?",2.0,2.0
rti0gm,"My husband and kids were home for today and by early morning I got the text from the coach saying that he wants to see me. I told him that it was tough for me to come over to which he replied that he wants me over there before afternoon.

So after everyone had their breakfast, I told my husband that I needed to go to the market to buy groceries. Upon hearing this my son said he wanted something as well and I left home. I drove to to the coach's place and upon seeing me he said that he knew that I'll come.

I asked him to make it quick and I lifted my saree up till my waist and bent over his couch. He walked behind me and slid my panties to a side and penetrated me. He fucked me in doggy position at first. Then pulled out and had me lay on my back and made me wrap my legs around him as he took me in missionary.

He kissed my tit over my blouse and I didn't wanted him to leave wet spots so I pulled my tit out for him to suck. He then finished inside me and I soon adjusted my clothes and got out of his place. I went to the market to buy groceries. While I was there, I got a call from the coach once again telling me to see him.

I went back to his place once again after shopping. Same couch same story. This time he took my ass and made his own leftover cum as lube. Then pulled out and made me suck his cock and ended up cumming inside my mouth.

I went back home and said the excuse that the shops were crowded due to new year and then went to my bathroom to clean up myself and got changed.

Most of people believe that this discrimination is because they are not able to decide for themselves, but in some countries and some areas the discrimination is lighter, which allows us to see that it is unfair to treat teenagers like they are currently treated. For example, in Austria the drinking age is 16, in USA the driving age is sometimes just 14, in Italy the age of consent is 14, in Austria the voting age is 16. These are all first world countries which function well even though teenagers are less discriminated, and there is no objective reason why the experience of these countries should not be applied to others.

sdhqcn,"I was (supposedly) casually seeing this guy Derek, I thought we had it established that we had a casual thing. From the way I said I don't want relationships, I just want a casual thing. 

Anyway he invited me to a 'bonfire' and I said sure, thinking it was a party? But I get there and there mostly weren't people our age, I'm 20 and he's 28. I realized soon that this was a family event. It was awkward because I had brought two friends with me, to party

Anyway, I was with my friends and his aunt came up to me to ask ""You're Derek's new girlfriend, aren't you? I was waiting for him to introduce you, you've been such a wallflower!"" 

I was like ""Uhh no we're just hanging out"" because I didn't think it was appropriate to tell his auntie that we're just hooking up. 

And she goes ""You're so shy; that's not what he said! You know you don't have to hide it like teenagers around us!"" 

I went ""Wait he said what?"" And she told me he had been saying I was his girlfriend. 

I was like ""Uhh that's news to me!"" 

Soon, Derek came over to my friends and I and he asked me what I'd said to his aunt. I asked what HE'D said to his aunt. 

And he said that he told people we were together because we were? 

I said ""what have I ever said that made you think I wanted a boyfriend, I literally said the opposite!"" 

He suddenly started saying that he loved me? It was so very out of left field, and I said ""You've known me for 2 months, you don't even know me let alone love me!"" And he said that he did, and that he loved how generous and caring and there for him I am. (I helped him with job interviews and helped him find a therapist) 

I said that those were things about what I do for him, not things about me! And did he know even the first thing about me? 

He said yes and I go ""What's my sister's name?"" He didn't know. ""What degrees am I studying for?"" He knew one of my two majors. ""Where did I grow up?"" No idea. ""What's my favorite color"" He didn't know.

I started raising my voice louder since I was so exasperated. That drew his family's attention. It got so awkward my friends and I left.

And afterwards, he sent me a furious text saying I misled him and humiliated him in front of his family. 

I asked what he meant I misled him, what about saying ""I don't want a relationship"" meant I want a relationship? And even if I said that, he still needs to ASK a girl if she will be his girlfriend, not have her be the last to know!

He sent me an angry text back saying I was acting like a girlfriend to him in all ways but title so he figured it was heading in that direction anyway. 

I was so baffled by that

Anyway, he's still angry and badmouthing me to everyone who will listen about how I led him on and humiliated him in front of his family when he brought me to meet them.

AITA for so publicly arguing and humiliating him in front of his family? 

))))

Edit to respond to some common questions:

> Why didn't you leave the get together when you realized it wasn't a party? 

My friends and I were actually trying to figure out how to leave, Derek had driven us there. The ubers were expensive since the house was out in the suburbs, we were having trouble finding an up to date bus schedule, and we didn't feel great about the idea of asking Derek for a lift because we were getting weirded out by the fact that he promised a party and took us to a family reunion. It was stressful because ubers were nearly $200 and none of us really had that kinda money to spare. Then his aunt started talking to us. 

> Did you lead him on?

I certainly tried not to. I told him at the start that I'm not interested in relationships, romance, or anything but casual sex. I'm focusing on my education and career. And I didn't treat him with any great emotional intimacy, I am way more emotionally intimate with my friends even!

> Did you invite friends to the get together without asking him? And did you assume it was a rager without asking? 

No, I asked if I could bring some friends and he said yeah.

I also felt like he was purposely not saying that the event was a family reunion and not a party with people our age, because my friends and I showed up to get in his car in sexy party dresses and with a backpack of vodka tequila and Trulys.

Even when we pulled up to the neighborhood and saw a whole ass house and my friends and I were like ""yoo your buddies must be RICH RICH"" because we were expecting a normal apartment he didn't say anything about it being his grandma's house!

It was super obvious what kinda event we were expecting and he said nothing...","AITA for yelling at this guy ""you don't love me, you don't even know me"" in front of his family?",2.0,2.0

rz90yf,"Imagine this: not being able to have feelings for any person of the opposite sex for literal 17 years; Finally have some feelings for a certain girl, make so many sacrifices for her (to the point of even ruining friendships with other people to get closer to her, to sacrifice precious time of yours just to hang out with them because ""they soon start uni again and won't come around the city for a while"", stay with them for hours on end when they feel depressed and need to unwind to someone, only to find out that when YOU crack and just go all out and tell everyone what's bothering you because of the alcohol you drank one night to forget everything you saw, heard or felt, THEY just walk off and let you be there, crying in a puddle of tears, even though they've been helped in the past by you, that when you're crying out for their name, for them to come to consolate you, the only person that's helping you it's their best friend). And when i had the feeling that i am finally getting somewhere with this friendship, ready for it to become more than a good friendship, tell her all your feelings, only 1 month later for them to hook up with someone else, that someone else being someone who has hated them in the past and said numerous things behind their back? Sounds kinda fucked up huh.  


I feel like this is the last straw that i can take. I feel like I always annoy my friends whenever i am trying to unwind to them, whenever I am feeling sad and just call them to take the things off my chest. I feel like whenever i tell them that I am not ok and that i should just cut my throat one day or just jump off a bridge or just simply disappear in a forest never to be seen again and they reply with ""no you can't do that, you're really important for us"" it's all out of simpathy. I feel like i should just disappear.  


I have suffered different depression episodes throughout my life. Been a disturbed individual for like 3 years now and only hoping that everyday will get better and better. Never had the courage to inflict any self harm other than just cutting my fingers because i can walk that off to my parents like a ""oh i cut myself by accident in something yesterday"" without being thrown into some therapist bullshit. I don't want a therapist. I can barely talk to people i know. Telling a human that i've never known prior everything that consumes me and my being is just an unreal concept that'd just take even more of a toll on me. But all of that changed last night when all of that shit happened. I just went out at 5 AM to the street, bought some alcohol and a pack of Advils and just gulped them down like there's no tomorrow, hoping that i'd die that night, but i wasn't in luck. Got back home where everyone was sleeping and just layed down on the kitchen floor with a knife, cutting every one of my fingers as much as i could. I wanted to die at that moment and if i were to die from the pills or just get the burst of courage to slash my throat, i didn't want to be seen. I just wanted to disappear in peace. Unlucky for me though because none of the knives were really that sharp to inflict any actual wounds. I am still here and feel miserable to the point of no return and feel like everything has just crumbled upon me.  


I really feel like i can't continue. I don't want to continue. I just want to be.. happy. At least for once in my adolescence, with that happiness to last for the rest of my life. But that happiness was never constant. It was only for maybe a few days only to be met again by some bullshit either in school or just my thoughts which i can't get over.

s8haem,"I've been a Chelsea fan since 2007/2008 and even though I've never exactly been a supporter of the way we treat our coaches, I've always understood the reason most of them were sacked. Di Matteo, Hidink, Grant and Villa Boas weren't good enough, Conte, Mourinho and Ancelotti had disagreements with the board and/or players. Even Lampard who I thought we should have supported for longer was an expected sacking because results just weren't coming our way.

Arguments could have been made for Conte and Ancelotti but I feel like no one has warranted more support than Tuchel. The man took over a young team with a lot of new players and turned them into Champions League winners in 6 months. Not only that but he's managed to win against pretty much every big team we've played against more than once. And most of all, and I can't stress this enough, he genuinely looks like he loves the club.

Because of all this I can't believe there's even rumors and conversations about him potentially being fired. The man won 2 trophies in less than a year and has already qualified us for another final (+ being favorites for the  CWC while FA cup and CL  are still up for grabs). Yes, we're in a rough spot, but why is this such a big deal? Which club hasn't had bad patches? Klopp's Liverpool played bang average football for his first full season, even Pep struggled to get the most out of City's team in the beginning.  Tuchel has achieved so much with a team that has 0 players that he personally wanted. You could argue Lukaku, but lets be honest, the board definitely pushed for him and he was one of the only realistic strikers available.

Tuchel needs time, needs a full team without star players being injured for months and transfers that he himself believes will help HIS squad. If we fail to give him that (which I genuinely believe is the absolute minimum) then I'll honestly lose all faith and support towards our board.

What better time than now to support a coach and see how it goes? He's still young for a coach, already proven and voted the BEST COACH OF THE YEAR, squad full of promising young talent and a CL already in the back pocket. Who are we realistically gonna sign with the tempo we've been hiring coaches? Who's genuinely better and realistic? We've already had and kicked out half of the world class coaches out there, Pep and Klopp won't come to us, the talent pool is gonna run dry eventually.

Sorry for the rant. Conclusion: We need to back Tuchel all the way, 100%. Any player that thinks he's more important can get the fuck out of our club and any fan that believes Tuchel should be sacked can go support Spuds.","If ever, now is the time to show patience and fully back the coach",2.0,2.0

I got his permission to post this. I'll ask later on when he gets up if I can add his name to the post.


I guess a quick back story of our relationship or how we know each other since a lot of our friends think were dating when we aren't. Him and I met from the healsluts discord a long time ago became really good friends then tried to date but didn't work out whatever shit happens, we ended up still being friends after stuff ended then stuff turned different we ended up doing sexual things even after we broke up kinda became friends with benefits type of thing.


Him and I both really enjoy destiny 2 he is much better then I ever will be. Some of the hardest content end game in destiny 2 is something called grandmaster nightfall. I have a toy that he can control with a app so I gave him a suggestion I told him I wanted him to watch me clear my first gm nightfall solo but with a twist I have toy in me and he gets to mess with it whenever he feels necessary. He then added if i don't fully beat it I wasn't allowed to cum, I never had gotten so wet in my life hearing that it was so hot when he said that but part of me was also extremely nervous.


Starting out I was already wet and really nervous I think he could tell because he didn't really use to toy at first more of just him calmly talking to me. He then started to mess with the settings of the toy and oh my fucking god I couldn't focus. My aim got worse and he started to pick on me about it calling me pathetic saying ""Aww you're already messing up pet we're just getting started though "" I end up losing focus because of the pleasure and I died. He then said ""You're such a dumb pet dying already time for your punishment""
He slowly started to turn to toy up getting all the way to max settings and left there then he told me go and keep playing at this point I'm a mess heavily breathing and whimpering. At this point the towel under me is soaked I end up dying almost right away again. He then make me go get my nipple claps and make me put them on till he says I can take them off. My nipples are extremely sensitive so any type of pain hurts really bad but I enjoy the pain so much it makes me really wet. He turns the toy to a low setting And says ""I see why I have to carry you through these you're so pathetic. Come on I turned the toy down now try to impress me this is your last life""
I try my best to collect myself and push through it but having hard time keep on track he's still messing with the setting making go slow then slowly raising it. I die again and that was my last life.
He tells to go get my paddle that I'm to spank myself 25 times on mic so can hear it. Before I start to spank myself he tells me to make sure my toy is still in. He turns the toy on the lowest setting as I'm starting to spank myself after i spank myself he turns it up a little this feeling is just so I don't even know how put it into words it hurts so bad after each hot but the pleasure from the toy makes it worth it so much.after about the 15 or so spank I can feel myself getting really close I start to ask Daddy can I cum please. He just laughs and says no calls me a dumb whore and that I need to keep going. Two more spanks later I literally can not handle the pleasure all I can say is daddy daddy daddy please. I then hear ""you're so pathetic fine I guess I'll let you come. Come on cum for me pet"" i felt the toy go even higher and I just let go of everything I was in pure bliss I came so hard I was shaking has never happened to me before I was kinda embarrassed. 

I think I laid there for about a hour or so after just relaxed and talking to him, he was also making sure I was fine and that everything was alright with me.

Elsewise no man will ever bend the knee to you. And any man who must say 'I am the king' is no true king at all. Aerys never understood that, but you will. When I've won your war for you, we will restore the king's peace and the king's justice. The only head that need concern you is Margaery Tyrell's maidenhead.""  
>  
>Joffrey had that sullen, sulky look he got. Cersei had him firmly by the shoulder, but perhaps she should have had him by the throat. The boy surprised them all. Instead of scuttling safely back under his rock, Joff drew himself up defiantly and said, ""You talk about Aerys, Grandfather, but you were scared of him.""  
>  
>Oh, my, hasn't this gotten interesting? Tyrion thought.  
>  
>Lord Tywin studied his grandchild in silence, gold flecks shining in his pale green eyes. ""Joffrey, apologize to your grandfather,"" said Cersei.  
>  
>He wrenched free of her. ""Why should I? Everyone knows it's true. My father won all the battles. He killed Prince Rhaegar and took the crown, while your father was hiding under Casterly Rock."" The boy gave his grandfather a defiant look. ""A strong king acts boldly, he doesn't just talk.""  
>  
>""Thank you for that wisdom, Your Grace,"" Lord Tywin said, with a courtesy so cold it was like to freeze their ears off. ""Ser Kevan, I can see the king is tired. Please see him safely back to his bedchamber. Pycelle, perhaps some gentle potion to help His Grace sleep restfully?"" *Tyrion VI ASOS.*

After the dust settles from that, Tyrion and Tywin speak alone.

>""Not Robert the Second,"" Tyrion said. ""Aerys the Third.""  
>  
>""The boy is thirteen. There is time yet."" Lord Tywin paced to the window. That was unlike him; he was more upset than he wished to show. ""He requires a sharp lesson.""  
>  
>Tyrion had gotten his own sharp lesson at thirteen. He felt almost sorry for his nephew. On the other hand, no one deserved it more. ""Enough of Joffrey,"" he said. ""Wars are won with quills and ravens, wasn't that what you said? I must congratulate you. How long have you and Walder Frey been plotting this?""  
>  
>""I mislike that word,"" Lord Tywin said stiffly. *Id.*

Two Tyrion POVs later, Joffrey dies--most likely from a poison--at his own wedding. I have read a number of comments of late that take the position that Tywin either killed Joffrey or allowed the murder. This thinking intrigued me as it was not something I ever considered. I thought it would be interesting to look at the arguments in support of the theory that Tywin played a role in Joffrey's death to see if they hold up under closer examination. Those in support of this theory offer several things to consider.

# Tywin is a ruthless and unsentimental person

Tywin ended House Reyne and House Tarbeck. Tywin gave the wife of his 13-year-old son to his household guard and then used semantic and a bag of silver to claim he did nothing wrong. At the Greenfork, Tywin put his own son in the vanguard that he hoped would be overrun by the enemy. Tywin had a hand in the purple wedding. Tyrion's and Jaime's assessment of their father seems true.

""My father once told me that a lord never lets sentiment get in the way of ambition."" *Tyrion IV ACOK.*

His father had never been unduly swayed by sentiment. *Jaime VI ASOS.*

Tywin is even reported as not being at all ill at ease over the possibility that Aerys might die at Duskendale because Rhaegar would make a far better king. So clearly Tywin is okay with a death if it yields an upgrade.

# Tommen is a better option for King

Tommen is noted as a gentle and more obedient child than Joffrey.

>""Joffrey is king.""  
>  
>""And Tommen is heir, should anything ill befall His Grace. Tommen, whose nature is so sweet, and notably . . . tractable.""  
>  
>""You have a suspicious mind, Varys."" *Tyrion IV ACOK.*

And later...

>""And you never go far enough."" Bronn tossed the wingbone to the rushes. ""Ever think how easy life would be if the other one had been born first?"" He thrust his fingers inside the capon and tore off a handful of breast. ""The weepy one, Tommen. Seems like he'd do whatever he was told, as a good king should.""  
>  
>A chill crept down Tyrion's spine as he realized what the sellsword was hinting at. If Tommen was king . . .  
>  
>There was only one way Tommen would become king. No, he could not even think it. Joffrey was his own blood, and Jaime's son as much as Cersei's. ""I could have your head off for saying that,"" he told Bronn, but the sellsword only laughed. *Tyrion IX ACOK.*

If Bronn has noticed the difference in the nature of the 2, surely Tywin has.

# Tywin did say Joffrey needed a lesson

>""The boy is thirteen. There is time yet."" Lord Tywin paced to the window. That was unlike him; he was more upset than he wished to show. ""He requires a sharp lesson."" *Tyrion IV ASOS.* 

Oh and there is this line as well.

>"" I did not fight a war to seat Robert the Second on the Iron Throne."" *Id.*

So between Tywin being ruthless, Joffrey upsetting him and Tommen being easier to control, it makes sense to suspect Tywin....except this is not all the text we should consider. And I take the position that once you look at what Tywin values, it (to my reading and interpretation) becomes very clear that Tywin did not do it.

# Ruthless? Yes. Kinslayer? Unlikely.

If you believe that Tywin killed Joffrey, then you are also arguing that Tywin is a Kinslayer. There is not much to suggest that he would do that. Tywin does not respond favorably to learning that Tyrion made threats about Tommen.

>""To save a whore's virtue, **you threatened your own House, your own kin?** Is that the way of it?"" *Tyrion I ASOS.*

Tywin has had issues with several members of his family to include his father and his youngest son. Nothing I could find indicates that he would kill a member of his family. And no, I do not think putting Tyrion in the vanguard counts as trying to kill your child. Fathers send their sons to war all the time in this story, I can find no example of such resulting in a kinslaying charge.

Kinslaying is an offense on par with breaking guest right something Tyrion brings up with Tywin.

>""So much for guest right.""  
>  
>""The blood is on Walder Frey's hands, not mine."" *Tyrion VI.*

I take that to mean that Tywin is aware of the taboo and has taken steps to distance himself from the offense. I believe he takes the same position on his kin and the prosperity of his house. So no, I do not think Tywin would kill his own grandson.

# Tommen isn't a better option, nor is such a public death

I get it. Tommen is gentler, more tractable and not at all volatile. Bronn thinks this, Varys thinks this, Tyrion thinks this and readers think this. But does Tywin think this? Well let's look at what Tywin values with respect to the future of the realm and see how well Tommen fits the bill.

The Tyrell union

Wedding House Tyrell to the Crown/House Lannister is one of Tywin's top priorities.

>But our alliance with Highgarden was the sword that broke Stannis. It should be tempered and made stronger. *Tyrion III ASOS.*

So in addition to the wedding between Joffrey and Margeary, he is thinking of other points to join the houses. When Mace Tyrell rejects the offer of Cersie for his heir, Tywin gets particularly invested in the wedding.

He goes through quite a bit of trouble to procure a rare and expensive wedding gift for Joffrey.

> His father glanced up. ""I did. Come have a look at this."" A bundle of oilcloth lay on the table between them, and Lord Tywin had a longsword in his hand. ""A wedding gift for Joffrey,"" he told Tyrion. The light streaming through the diamond-shaped panes of glass made the blade shimmer black and red as Lord Tywin turned it to inspect the edge, while the pommel and crossguard flamed gold. **""With this fool's jabber of Stannis and his magic sword, it seemed to me that we had best give Joffrey something extraordinary as well. A king should bear a kingly weapon.""**  
>  
>""That's much too much sword for Joff,"" Tyrion said.  
>  
>**""He will grow into it.** Here, feel the weight of it."" He offered the weapon hilt first.   *Tyrion IV ASOS.*

Tywin wants the king to be seen wielding an extraordinary sword. Tommen is much younger and much smaller than Joff. If Widow's Wail is about too much for 13-year-old Joff, it is way too much for Tommen. Hence, one of Tywin's priorities cannot be completed by Tommen. And that is not the only sword Tommen is too young to wield.

>""When I've won your war for you, we will restore the king's peace and the king's justice. **The only head that need concern you is Margaery Tyrell's maidenhead.""** *Tyrion VI ASOS.*

When he speaks of a marriage, Tywin is talking about the importance of a consummation, something that Tommen at 8 is too young to do. Consummation is not some one-off either; it is a very high priority to Tywin. 

>""Your sister swears she's flowered. If so, she is a woman, fit to be wed. **You must needs take her maidenhead, so no man can say the marriage was not consummated.** After that, if you prefer to wait a year or two before bedding her again, you would be within your rights as her husband."" *Tyrion III ASOS.*

In Tywin's mind, a marriage is nothing if it is not consummated.

> ""She is old enough to be Lady of Winterfell once her brother is dead. Claim her maidenhood and you will be one step closer to claiming the north. Get her with child, and the prize is all but won. **Do I need to remind you that a marriage that has not been consummated can be set aside?""**  
>  
>""By the High Septon or a Council of Faith. Our present High Septon is a trained seal who barks prettily on command. Moon Boy is more like to annul my marriage than he is.""  
>  
>""Perhaps I should have married Sansa Stark to Moon Boy. He might have known what to do with her.""  *Tyrion IV ASOS.*

Tywin wants a Tyrell and Crown/Lannister union that cannot be set aside. Tommen is not old enough to consummate the union, which places the alliance at risk. Now sure, some might argue that Tommen wedding Margaery would be enough. And while that might be enough for you fine reader, we have to ask is that enough for Tywin? Well consider this, after Mace rejects Cersie and Joffrey dies, does Tywin immediately turn to Tommen for the wedding? No, he does not.

> ""You do."" Lord Tywin rose as well. ""A duty to House Lannister. You are the heir to Casterly Rock. That is where you should be. Tommen should accompany you, as your ward and squire. The Rock is where he'll learn to be a Lannister, and I want him away from his mother. I mean to find a new husband for Cersei. Oberyn Martell perhaps, once I convince Lord Tyrell that the match does not threaten Highgarden. And it is past time you were wed. **The Tyrells are now insisting that Margaery be wed to Tommen, but if I were to offer you instead‚Äî**"" \[...\]

Tommen is so ill-suited to the goal Tywin has set, that he is thinking about how to buy Jaime out of the KG. (Admittedly there are some other benefits to this for Tywin as well. He never wanted to lose his heir to the KG.) This does not say to me that Tommen is a better option to bind the Tyrells or to wield Widow's Wail.

Beyond the consummated union, Tywin is very interested in the spectacle of the wedding itself.

>""You will find whatever gold is required.""   
>  
>""Will I? Where? The treasury is empty, I've told you that. We're not done paying the alchemists for all that wildfire, or the smiths for my chain, and Cersei's pledged the crown to pay half the costs of Joff's wedding‚Äîseventy-seven bloody courses, a thousand guests, a pie full of doves, singers, jugglers . . .""  
>  
>**""Extravagance has its uses. We must demonstrate the power and wealth of Casterly Rock for all the realm to see.""**  *Tyrion IV ASOS.*

Tywin wants the realm to see how wealthy and powerful House Lannister is. How does poisoning Joffrey in front of the most influential people in Westeros accomplish a show of power? It does not. It makes the Crown and House Lannister look vulnerable. Isn't that right Melisandre?

>""To be sure, Your Grace. One king might die by chance, even two . . . but three? **If Joffrey should die in the midst of all his power, surrounded by his armies and his Kingsguard,** would not that show the power of the Lord at work?""  *Davos V ASOS.*

Killing Joffrey in such a public arena with several KG around him all powerless to help him makes the Crown and House Lannister look weak. And I do not think anyone can dispute that Tywin despises weakness.

# Death is not a lesson for the dead

Yes, Tywin said Joffrey needed a sharp lesson. A lesson is some event or action that serves to teach a person so that they can adjust actions in the future. Killing Joffrey does not teach him, rather it places him beyond any learning.

When Tywin learned that Ser Lorimer was stealing from his personal stores, he had Lorimer hanged. This was not a lesson for Lorimer but rather everyone else.

>Far from home, alone, and penniless, the boy had attached himself to a fat hedge knight named Ser Lorimer the Belly, who was part of Lord Lefford's contingent, charged with protecting the baggage train. ""The boys who guard the foodstuffs always eat the best,"" Ser Lorimer liked to say, until he was discovered with a salted ham he'd stolen from Lord Tywin's personal stores. **Tywin Lannister chose to hang him as a lesson to other looters.** Podrick had shared the ham and might have shared the rope as well, but his name had saved him. Ser Kevan Lannister took charge of him, and sometime later sent the boy to squire for his nephew Tyrion.   *Brienne III AFFC.*

The sharp lesson to Tyrion and Tysha (monstrously cruel as it was) was not fatal to either. 

> ""Try harder. Did you have her killed?""  
>  
>His father pursed his lips. **""There was no reason for that, she'd learned her place** . . . and had been well paid for her day's work, I seem to recall. I suppose the steward sent her on her way. I never thought to inquire.""   *Tyrion XI ASOS.* 

When Tywin kills, it is a lesson to others not the person he has killed. When he killed the entire line of Reyne and Tarbek, he was sending a lesson to any other vassals who might consider giving rebellion. When he had the Bloody Mummers put to the sword, he was sending a lesson to any other person who entered his employment and sought to betray him. 

Tywin had invested time and resources in Joffrey's reign. Furthermore, he was without good options beyond Joffrey to serve his immediate plans. And finally, in Tywin's own words he had not yet given up on Joffrey.

>""The boy is thirteen. There is time yet."" *Tyrion VI ASOS.*

So whatever sharp lesson he had planned for Joffrey, death wasn't it. So what say you fine members of this community, did Tywin do it? Did I miss some evidence in support of his involvement? Constructive feedback and polite disagreement are always welcome.

**TL;DR: The textual evidence strongly supports that Tywin did not plan nor permit Joffrey's poisoning at the wedding. All of Tywin's interests are tied to Joffrey and Tommen is not capable of completing the tasks Tywin needs. While Tywin is heartless enough of an asshole to kill just about anyone, Tywin is far too smart to harm his own position by killing Joffrey for talking back.**","[Spoilers Main] About That ""Sharp Lesson"" Tywin Planned",2.0,2.0

s9mpnj,"Two nights ago, I returned home at around 6pm from planned parenthood. The guy who got me pregnant accompanied me, to the appointment, then brought me back to his place so I wouldn‚Äôt be alone while I took the pills. This was my second abortion, first I had at 21, and I actually wrote on this sub a  while back my experience with it, after it was done with. Now I‚Äôm 23, round two with the pill abortion. I waited initially two hours after I got to his place to insert all 4 pills, because I was mentally preparing to go through the physical pain of it all, again. My first experience was traumatic enough to me with the level of pain. 

Two more hours go by, I‚Äôm laying on his bed waiting a decade at this point for this stuff to dissolve inside me, swear I almost fell asleep waiting on these pills to start working. My ex years ago when I first took the abortion pills never went to the pharmacy to pick up the over the counter pain meds for me, so the pain was excruciating. This time, I wanted to be more prepared to minimize pain, I took either Tylenol or ibuprofen, can‚Äôt remember which, then put a heating pad on my stomach. Halfway through this terrible Michael bay movie the guy who got me into this mess put on, the pain starts from the cramps. The medication did not work, and the heating pad actually intensified nausea, prompting me to rush into his bathroom and vomit everywhere, also having Diarrhea multiple times throughout the night, all while intensely painful cramping happened. It was hell. I felt like death. I was incredibly weak, had terrible cold sweats, too. Around 1am at the height of the intense pain, the guy tells me I have to go home. There was no way I could go home in this much pain, I couldn‚Äôt even move, I was screaming almost at one point from the pain, begging for ibuprofen. I would‚Äôve also been alone at home. He told me this 4 times, he has to take me home, as I was in the corner of his bed in a fetal position shaking in cold sweat from the cramps. Not able to physically get up. Eventually, he most likely came to his senses, and let me stay. His reasoning was he wanted his bed to himself, for wanting me to leave at literally the worst of my cramping. I even told him I‚Äôd Uber home once it‚Äôs over and I‚Äôm able to move without pain, but he for awhile wasn‚Äôt agreeing. Finally at around 2am it was over. I was shaking uncontrollably until 4am I noticed due to getting over the shock of the pain and vomiting.

ruhnom,"I moderate here (this Post is just me as a normal user though) , so I see a lot of stuff that never makes it out for the public to view and the one thing that becomes really obvious is that there are a number of people who are simply addicted to conflict.

In Psychological terms ""Conflict Addition"" is most often mentioned in addiction recovery and relationship counseling circles and it has a long history there.

What we see here seems to be a reflection of what we see on Social Media where polarized political factions go at it and incessantly try to out insult each other - so this is most likely a societal problem that isn't exclusive to our subreddit.

**So what is Conflict Addiction?**

In it's most basic terms it is the need for an adrenaline rush based in it's most primal way on the fight or flight instinct.

In Psychological circles it really became associated with recovering substance abusers because of their need to get a rush when their drug of choice was denied from them, and in Relationship Counseling it was identified as something that kept couples fighting and instigating those spats to compensate for a lack of passion and intimacy.

Social Media and the Internet added a whole new dimension to this by providing other venues for people to fulfill their Conflict Addiction and need for that adrenaline rush associated with it.

Internet Trolls are often just people seeking engagements to get ""a fix"", and this term ""engagements"" is really important to the Social Media driven aspect of this phenomenon.

&#x200B;

**How it affects us on this Subreddit**

We see Conflict Addiction ""engagements"" all the time here in the constant back and forth between those who have experienced the Effect first hand and the debunkers of it or those who are willing to entertain more exotic explanations and the Scientific Materialists who will have no part of anything that they can't touch or prove with Science.

Most of those engagements are OK but all too often they cross the line and become overly aggressive - fitting perfectly into the realm of defined Conflict Addiction based behavior.

The thing we face now that Society has never really had to face  before in a *Sign of the Times* way is that these very ""engagements"" are highly prized by Social Media platforms for the revenue that ""clicks"" generate, and they have found that conflict and outrage are the best way to get those engagements

There is a good documentary that describes this process called [""The Social Dilemma""](https://www.thesocialdilemma.com/) and I would encourage everyone to check it out.

Our issues aren't uncommon or insurmountable if we know what they are and how to face them.","My personal view on what I see as the biggest problem this subreddit suffers from - ""CONFLICT ADDICTION""",2.0,2.0

I don't think so.

Many people already think that Ashara Dayne is the mother of Jon Snow. Daynes are known to have Silver Hair and Purple Eyes, despite them being First Men and not being descended from Valyrians. Ashara was known for her Haunting Violet Eyes. So, if Jon was born with Targeryen traits, everyone would have assumed that those are actually Dayne traits and that Ashara is the mother of Jon Snow. That would've actually been more convincing to people and they would not wonder if Jon's mother is Ashara or Wylla or someone else.

We booked concert tickets the day prior, All he told me was that 8 years was too long, I am perfect but he needs to figure himself out, and he sees a therapist. I wished him genuinely well and he left.

Back to the nightmare I was on this Reddit before I fell asleep and had a nightmare that I reached out and he hated me from this. It was so traumatic but came across so realistic. Recently in real life I had a best friend of his reach out to randomly to ask me how I am and that he wouldn‚Äôt hate me if I hated my ex ? This best friend is someone I didn‚Äôt speak too to much either but someone who my ex speaks to and confines in. I never expected his best friend to contact me. This is his best friend, and he tells me he still incredibly cares for me and wants me to be okay, this really threw off my good on track healing process. How could he care? This was mentioned in the dream that he fell out with the said friend. 

The conclusion  I have gathered is i don‚Äôt know how he is and his thoughts, that‚Äôs what he chose to do to me after all , and solidified and instilled fear in to me to not reach out.

rwrkb9,"So today has been a slow slow day I just got in from hunting and decided to order my self a pizza and well it just reminded me of something that happened when I was just a little girl.

I was fairly young at the time in high school so around 14-15 and my class had just finished the grade 9 academic testing (in Ontario in grade 9 every student in Ontario is required to write and pass a bunch of tests (language writing reading) I was English as a second language so I was exempt from the writing portion of the test (thank god)

well to celebrate my home room teacher said were going to have a party everyone has to bring in a few $ and have some paper signed so its ok to eat the standard school stuff.

I want to make sure you know my father is a total POS not only is he sexist classist throw racist and any other IST you can think of in that mix even then your not even getting near to how shitty of a person he is.

He had been away for a few weeks on business and that was always a great time for me when I was a kid unfortunately he came home that week (we never knew when he would come or go)

and my stupid ass left the permission slip in the kitchen on the table and he found it.

I honestly don't remember exactly what he said it was a long time ago and well I think that's for the best

but that man read that oh his kid is going to be at a party oh his kid is going to be eating food and having friends that are beneath his class

the man screamed me down stairs to interrogate me what this was and i was its just a school thing its only pizza

&#x200B;

well that made him start the lecture If i eat western food ill be fat if eat pizza ill be fat and no acceptable man will want me that I will become a prostitutes' he was going to be at the house for at least two weeks

he actually got so mad he called my school and called me in sick he lied saying ill be out for a while because i am so sick.

that man did not let my mother go shopping once at least until he left on another business trip but for the entire time he was home I was not let to eat anything but vegetables raw cabbage raw spinach

now I am and have always been a small itsy bitsy tiny woman i stand at 4,8"" and now that I am in my 30s I have never once been over 80 lbs.

so imagine what happened after two weeks of that I was even thinner really starving it took over a month to recover I remember being at school just being so weak  and everyone was wow you must of been really sick......

well now its my lunchtime and I am half way through a large pizza (: Fuck you dad

edit: so after the Christmas incident I called a friend of mine he used the plate information i gave to track my father down

the man right now is living in a shitty motel its not only the kind where depressed roaches go to die But you can also pay by the 30 min so karma is not only a bitch but my best friend",If you eat Pizza you will be a whore,2.0,2.0

s7pcb6,"Last night, while I was intimate with my husband, I tried to get him to do more than the vanilla sex we usually have. He was reluctant. So reluctant in fact that we stopped having sex all together. I tried to explain that I wanted more out of our sex lives, but he was surprisingly judegmental.

He basically accused me of being a liar for our entire relationship. That I wasn't upfront and honest about my desires from the start. Then he told me that he could not do what I was asking for. I think the most hurtful thing is that he looked at me so differently, with this barely masked look of disgust. Like he couldn't believe what I was asking him to do, like I was some deviant. I never felt so small and so ashamed.

He left me there in the bedroom alone. I heard him leave the house. I couldn't believe it. All I tried to do was communicate with him about what I wanted. I even tried to get him to open up about things he may want, but he insisted he was happy with the way things were. That's when he got angry.

Of course am not without fault, I did something terrible, but that indiscretion lead me to realize that I was hungry for more with my husband. Yet there I was alone, unsatisfied, and hurt. My husband abandoned me after I tried to improve things for both of us. My husband judged me based on my sexual desires. I still can't belive it.

My ex had texted me earlier that day to apologize for letting things happen the way they did a week ago. And instead of ignoring him I ended up texting with him for some time. I'm not sure why. Maybe it's because he doesn't judge me. I eventually turned the conversation sexual. I was frustrated that I was left unsatisfied and abandoned. I needed release, and I got it while sexting my ex.

Afterwards I laid in my marital bed and considered that maybe everyone was right about me. Maybe I am just a horrible cheating slut and I was going to keep cheating. I mean I just sexted to completion with my ex boyfriend after trying to repair my sex life. I'd consider that cheating. I also made plans to meet up with him again. It was in the moment, I should probably cancel, but why? I mean at this point why stop? My husband looks at me like a depraved slut, so far everyone who has read my confessions thinks I'm a depraved slut, maybe I should just be a fucking slut.

Why couldn't my husband have tried to give me what I need? I would've done anything for him. Why can't he do the same for me? I hate this. So many conflicting feelings.

rusyll,"This is my (F) personal fantasy that I have been craving lately - being used as a fuck toy for my sir and a stranger.


My sir buckles my hands behind me before putting a blindfold over my eyes. I'm on the floor, on my knees, waiting. I hear my sir walk away for a moment - I hear 2 footsteps coming back. 

A hand grabs my hair, and I feel 2 fingers pushed into my mouth. I open my mouth obediently but the fingers disappear and a cock takes it place. I instantly know it's not my sir and I pull my head back. My sir growls into my ear ""Baby girl you are going to suck his cock until he tells you to stop."" I whimper and open my mouth again, feeling the strangers dick slide all the way to the back. I can't breath. My eyes start to water under the blindfold. The hand jn my hair start to pull my head back and forth, and my sir whispers ""take it all baby girl"" into my ear.

My pussy is already dripping wet from this. Suddenly the stranger pulls back and turns my head, and my sir shoves his cock into my mouth. The stranger holds my head while my sir fucks my face. Being treated like a fuck toy is only making me wetter every second. I feel fingers squeezing my nipples and I start to squirm. Suddenly I'm pulled upright and pushed face first into the wall. I don't know who is holding me there. I feel the head of someone's cock press into me. There's a hand on the back of my head pressing my face into the wall, and 2 hands around my hips pulling me back.

The person behind me positions themselves and slides in and I instantly cum. The person pulls back and I hear their voice for the first time, growling jn my ear. ""Who gave you permission to cum little one?""

""No one, I'm sorry!""

The stranger grips my throat and pulls my head back and I hear his voice in my ear ""Sorry what? You will call me daddy""

""I'm sorry daddy"" I say. ""Not good enough"" he says, squeezing my throat harder. I feel 2 fingers go to my clit and I don't know who is touching me - there is still a hand pulling my hair and a hand wrapped around my throat, forcing my head back. My sir tells me I'm not allowed to cum until I'm given permission. The fingers on my clit start to move, and I feel another hand on my breast, squeezing hard. The hand pinches a nipple, while the fingers at my clit start to move faster. The hand around my hair falls away and I feel it move down my back, down between my legs. A finger slips into my pussy and it's too much. I'm going to cum and I don't know how long I can hold it for.

""Sir, daddy, please!""  

""Please what little one?"" 

""Please let me cum!""

The finger inside me starts to move faster, and I feel a second finger slip inside. 

""You can cum baby girl"" my sir whispers to me, and I let go, feeling the sensation slip all over me, down to my toes, through my stomach, all around me.

sctoir,"Even since I was a little child, Australia Day never sat right with me. I was born in the 80s and my parents emigrated from south-eastern europe. I was bullied for a while in school - I was the 'wog' kid with the curly hair and stinky salami sandwiches that smelled like 'feet.' Everytime I tried to make friends with the 'Aussie kids,' I was ostracised, and ended up just befriending the Asian, Latino, Indian, Arabic etc kids and it continued that way until university, where I met some lovely Australian (Anglo-Saxon) friends and am still friends with these lovely souls to this day. 

Nevertheless, Australia Day always makes me feel sad. 

Perhaps as I internalised what it means to be a 'true' Aussie back in the 80s (blonde-ish, sporty, super confident...Anglo-Saxon) and never resonated with that. I cognitively appreciate the push for a multicultural meaning of what it is to 'be Australian,' but the history and significance of January 26 isn't really based on a multicultural Australia since it paved the way for genocide of Indigenous peoples. I can't imagine how alienated and confused they feel on January 26th??

rxv931,"For context, I've (early 30s M) been in a relationship with my partner (early 30s F) for about 2 years, but was in another relationship for 7 years almost immediately prior to that.

Issue is I've been reading and hearing about polyamory a lot over the past year - it's really only been the past month or so I started to think it may apply to me. I understand that it may seem like I just want to sleep with other people, but I really enjoy connecting with people, and especially on a deeper level. I also understand that if it was something I pursued, it would be fair for my partner to also pursue other people - and I'm OK with the idea, I don't think I've ever been jealous of my partner being friendly to other guys in the past (yes I know it's different - but I'm trying to imagine the scenario and it doesn't seem to scare me).

I know there's a lot to consider, but I just feel that if I view my personality and values through the lens of being poly, everything sort of makes a lot more sense? But similarly I find the idea a bit scary for a few reasons... it's fairly late in life for me to make this discovery about myself, so I don't know if it's really true? And am I just being selfish? I mean, I've always been monogamous based on 9 years of being in relationships, but I don't know whether it's what I wanted or whether it was just expected of me.

Anyway any advice would be welcome. Feel free to ask probing/hard questions to help me get my head around this, but please be kind!","Thinking for the first time I may be poly. I'm in a monogamous relationship, and so are most people I know. Uh-oh.",2.0,2.0
s72pdv,"As per title, I have dated a lot over the years and it's the same 90% of the time in my own experience. There's some kind of false assumption that I should be paying all the time, as I'm the man. And when I meet a girl who actually seems really nice, and yet she still expects me to pick up the tab? It's off-putting. This is not just first dates, but also when we've extended to numerous dates.

The problem is not so much the question in itself, it's just a fair question/comment. But, it's very difficult to put this across WITHOUT killing the vibe a bit. And that's because most women WANT men to pay. There's something very awkward that eminates from the women in this moment. And no, it's not me. If somebody is comfortable paying for it in the first place, you are going to offer in the first place. If you don't, you're expecting the other person to do it for you. And if she agrees to your suggestion, she's likely doing it ONLY because of the awkwardness of it. Inside she's not comfortable with it.

And often I have had dates where I have footed a big bill, and then she will offer to pay for a coffee or something that doesn't cost anywhere near as much. I mean, am I supposed to feel good about it? It just makes it all the more worse, because when someone does this they are aware that they haven't paid their share on something, and the coffee is a token way of trying to show some kind of acknowledgement. But when they have been treated to a ¬£50 dinner/drinks, and they buy you a coffee for ¬£5 - what man would NOT be insulted? And let's not pretend that this is cool just because 'some men are happy to do it'. This kind of thinking in this day and age is wrong.

This is a very difficult situation for men. It shouldn't have to be so difficult. It is the biggest sign to me that I do not want to take anything further beyond the physical. How/why would a man feel respected after that? I feel the opposite. And as mentioned, when it's a person who has a good job and seems well rounded and still does this, I scratch my head and wonder what the hell is going on. Why would I feel enthusiastic about seeing this person again?

&#x200B;

EDIT: A FEW THINGS TO CLEAR UP ------------

1. People keep suggesting I'm broke, I ain't. I have the money. It's about principle. I don't want to pay a woman for her time. There's brothels for that.
2. Thanks for all the dogs abuse I have been receiving. Essentially, this is online bullying. But I'm old enough to not let it deeply affect me. Good effort though. Hope you are proud of your bullying antics.
3. Finally, thanks to my many supporters who have liked, given awards, sent me PM's etc. Wokeness is a big big problem today and the fact that I have received so much dogs abuse just for saying I don't want to pay for a woman's time, is well, quite sad. Remember folks, divorce is higher than ever. No means no. Equal means equal too. A partnership is a two way street.

ryfxoy,"Another day, another stupid ban from the mods. Apparently calling someone ""delusional"", a word that simply means ""having false or unrealistic beliefs or opinions"" and saying ""incapable of understanding"" to someone who doesn't understand what I said are personal attacks and worthy of a 7 day ban.

Not just that of course even though it is idiotic enough as it is, they deleted all my comments. Not just the one with the ""personal attacks"", all of them, even the comments before that didn't have those personal attacks. Why? Normally I wouldn't share private messages but fuck those guys so here's why.

I confronted them after the ban asked what was considered as ""personal attack"" and here's the reply.

>Both parties involved were punished, based on their previous history of warnings. You commented on someone else's post, called them ""delusional and incapable of understanding"", then proceeded to argue with them over multiple comments, because they had a different opinion to your own, and yes, I'd class this as a personal attack.

I want to specifically point out this part, ""then proceeded to argue with them over multiple comments, because they had a different opinion to your own"". Correct me if I'm wrong but isn't this the whole point of reddit? 

Also the part where he said ""I'd class this as a personal attack."". Not that it **is** a personal attack, he classifies it as one. Basically he just wanted to ban me, he just can't admit it.

Then I say 

>Since when ""delusional"" is a personal attack? Are we classifying everything we don't like as ""personal attack"" now? Or if it just comes from people we don't like? Someone literally calls me a ""motherfucker"" and you guys do nothing but I call someone ""delusional"", which is certainly not a personal attack, and I got banned? Is this a joke?
>
>""then proceeded to argue with them over multiple comments, because they had a different opinion to your own""
>
>What? That's the whole point of reddit, what do you think it is, promotion for the game?
>
>Also, this supposed ""personal attack"" was after my initial comment, why is first comment is deleted? You could delete the problematic comment be done with it, why delete everything?
>
>So in short you guys just ban whoever you want, that's it. And it mostly happens to be people who are critical, I wonder why...

and he replies,

>This isn't a case of what YOU consider to be a personal attack. You were banned, the other person involved has also been banned. The argument was aggressive and non-constructive. If it was a debate, that would've been fine. But instead you just say ""you're simply wrong"", ""delusional"", ""incapable of understanding""... The whole thread of comments between you was deleted, both yours and the other person.
>
>Finally, this isn't a personal thing, I don't care if you criticise the game in a constructive manner. This wasn't it. This was you attacking someone for having a different opinion to you, then trying to force your opinion onto someone else as fact.

It's not a case of what I consider, it is a case of what HE considers of course. I'm pretty sure he can't even detect the hypocricy there.

""But instead you just say ""you're simply wrong"", ""delusional"", ""incapable of understanding""... The whole thread of comments between you was deleted, both yours and the other person.""

So I need to reply in a specific way or I get banned. That's it, this is why I got banned and all my comments are deleted because they didn't like them.

After this he muted me, because we can't have a discussion about unfair actions, even in private.

Please, tell me if I'm in the wrong here, be completely honest, is this ban fair and did my comments required deleting? I respect you guys, even if you think I'm wrong that won't change. I'm pretty angry so forgive me for this but,

As usual, we'd love to hear your feedback. We've been getting a ton of useful information from you all, and it really does help to steer us in the right direction with development. Just a remind - please keep things on topic, be constructive, and be nice to one another. As for meeting notes this week, you can read them below:  


* Arid, the map slated for the second half of Eastern Invasion, is our main priority. Pretty much all artists and devs that can help are all-hands-on-deck to get things developed. Usually when a map is being made, we have a few artists working on that map while the rest handle other tasks. This time around we're getting all artists to focus on Arid, and to stop work on non-map making tasks (which should speed up development).
* Texture work has been going on with Arid to get it up to par with other maps we've recently released, as well as asset work for some unique buildings on the level. Block-outs, some structure changes, etc. are underway but we're hoping that some new changes in how we make maps should speed stuff up.
* Some planning is underway for more voices - ideally, they will be included with EI part two.
* Issues with the scoreboard/player list have been fixed internally. This should restore the ""view steam profile"" option, etc. with the next update.
* Maintenance and some improvements are underway for the SDK.
* Backend work for development purposes has been a big topic for us; we've got a physical office now and the furniture, internet, etc. is all set up, and we're switching over some version control stuff at the office.

But I see people here who love it. Who *thrive* on it. Not in the everyday lives we lead, but as a kink. As something that fires us up, gives up some drive in our personal lives, where the usual pedestrian mores don't count and the naysayers and racists and race hustlers can't light us up faster than the US Marines can prep a landing zone. It's private, and it's something that happens between as people as opposed to races.

At this point it's become a proud, kinky trope. Even on here, you see the foaming at the mouth hate on an almost daily basis, with one particular nutjob calling her a ""Transphobic cunt"", when really, she's simply pointing out what the police said:

""A document approved by Fiona Taylor, deputy chief constable, confirms that the force has requested permission not to comply in full with the act until 2023. Officers‚Äô representatives said the quarterly report highlighted glaring problems posed by legislation widely perceived by the public to have made it an offence to ‚Äúhurt people‚Äôs feelings‚Äù.

A 76 per cent rise in reported crimes in which transgender issues was the aggravating factor contrasted with 6.1 per cent growth in all hate crime reports, and reflected the impact of online rows about trans rights and gender identity, according to the Scottish Police Federation. ‚Äú**I expect that large parts of the rise will be people taking offence at things they read on Twitter and don‚Äôt agree with**,‚Äù said Calum Steele, the federation‚Äôs general secretary.""",A 76% rise in hate crime reports along with yet another TRA threatening to kill Joanna Cherry.,2.0,0.0

s3zmvu,"After **SEVEN weeks of eligibility**, children are desperately unvaccinated in Ontario. While I understand from my own experience that many parents have booked an appointment and have not asked for early vaccination (i.e., are waiting a full eight weeks to February-ish), it seems like more than that is going on.

Ontario is vaccinating children at roughly 30,000 first doses for kids per week, and even less second doses. At a total population of just more than a million, it will take about 2/3 of a year to vaccinate all kids. 

Here are the facts, as reported by Public Health Ontario:

[https://www.publichealthontario.ca/en/data-and-analysis/infectious-disease/covid-19-data-surveillance/covid-19-data-tool?tab=vaccine](https://www.publichealthontario.ca/en/data-and-analysis/infectious-disease/covid-19-data-surveillance/covid-19-data-tool?tab=vaccine)

* Jan 01, 2022: Children with one dose: 467, 574 / fully vaccinated: 13769
* Jan 08, 2022: Children with one dose: 498,488 / fully vaccinated: 37624
* The total population of children 5-11 in the province is 1 078 527.

For a province in which parents are BURSTING at the seams to bitch about the failures of the Provincial Government... While the government certainly has failed in a number of ways, it seems like parents in Ontario seem to be not stepping up to get things done in the ONE WAY in which they can control themselves. 

If you're a parent out there, or know one - what's the deal? I had my 5-year-old vaccinated the fastest I possibly could, so what's going on that people are just letting this slide? 

We all go back to school on Monday, and it seems like nobody is rushing to do the most important thing?

With recent *controversy* about a certain coffee roaster - I noticed a few people looking to be a bit more conscious about their coffee choices and wondering where they can get a decent bag of beans!

I've been in the coffee scene for almost 10 years and am very happy to help (and for others to chime in) direct you to a roaster that could have the right coffee for you.

Just let me know what kind of coffee you like and if you're comfortable, whereabouts in Melbourne you are and I'll hit you with a suggestion (or two... or three... we've got a lot of good coffee in Melbourne!)

Or if you've just got any coffee questions in general give me a shout :)

Yes, it's a friendship/relationship that is 13 years in the making but that doesn't mean that he has to mack on her within minutes of meeting in person.

I've never been in an online relationship, but I imagine it has to be a bit weird at the first meeting. Give them both some time to feel each other out and get to know the real Alina/Caleb. When I've flown long-distance, all I want is a shower and sleep when I get to my destination. If I felt the pressure to perform shortly after an exhausting trip, that would not be ideal.

I felt that Elijah was trying to start shit with Caleb the entire time. He's clearly a good friend to Alina and I understand him being protective. But, dude, give the guy the benefit of the doubt and step off. Let them work it out on their own. Alina is a grown-ass woman who can make her own choices. If she isn't feeling Caleb, then she will speak for herself. She doesn't need him to defend her.

Also, let's consider how Caleb is feeling in this weird situation. Meeting someone you've been messaging/video calling with for so many years and having her friend grill you the entire time. I'd be. on guard too.

rypclh," We've been hearing the land tax a lot and many folks are not quite sure about it and a sizeable amount are straight out against it without truly understand the benefits.. issues that comes with it.

So I've pretty much copy and pasted them here from an economist that knows what he's talking about.

**Pros:**

\* Brings in property to tax base. NZ has relatively low property taxes compared to other countries.

\* Progressive tax hits richest hardest and hits those with most children least, as they have less land

\* Hits Maori and Pacific Island communities least

\* Likely to cause rental property investors to rethink

\* Very cheap to administer

\* No avoidance or evasion

\* Land is immobile so no danger of assets 'fleeing' tax

\* Per hectare threshold reduces hit on farmers and foresters

\* Threshold cleaner and easier to administer than exceptions

\* Discourages land-banking property developers from sitting on land

\* Less borrowing for property investment and lower overseas debt

**Cons**

\* 0.5% land tax could reduce land values by as much as 15%

\* House prices (land and buildings) could fall by 4-8%

\* House price falls depends whether tax is deductible, level of real interest rates, other local body rates

\* Retired households hit hardest

\* Young homeowners with little equity, low discretionary income hit relatively harder

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

About the last 2 points in the cons department ..I think we  mitigate that by excluding first home buyers and owner occupied houses from the land tax . 

&#x200B;

So there you have it..is it a net benefit to NZ society in general? Yes.

&#x200B;

Is it bad news for investors?

rkr3iu,"Just need to scream into the void‚Ä¶

Not even sure if this is a good place to post this but I gotta get it off my chest. 

I‚Äôve been infatuated by the sissy fetish for years. Crossdressed in the privacy of my house almost any chance I got and I‚Äôve come to really like the feminine side of myself. I like my body. I like what I can do sexually as far as sucking and fucking but I‚Äôve now come to the realization that I spent so much time on the ‚Äúlook‚Äù that I never even thought of a ‚Äúpersona‚Äù or voice work‚Ä¶

I had a weekend in the city and had a hotel to myself. MUCH needed weekend of privacy. I don‚Äôt live alone. This is a VERY rare opportunity so I brought ALL my sissy stuff and spent time shaving completely, pampering, and getting all dolled up to find a guy and release some of my inner desires that I had been suppressing for years‚Ä¶ 

I have been with roughly 10 guys in my life so I know what I‚Äôm doing but I had never been able to do this is sissy mode so it was finally time to do it. I‚Äôve only been outside while crossdressed 1 other time in my life so it‚Äôs a pretty big deal to me and I‚Äôm constantly riddled with anxiety. So I‚Äôm a nervous wreck but still happy because I love it. I gather the courage to go outside dressed up a couple times just out to my vehicle in the parking garage and it was a thrill. Scary but so fun to be in a dress and heels with my bare shaved legs exposed. It was seriously euphoric and intoxicating in itself. 

Finally match up with a decent looking guys and decide to take the plunge. Told him where I was. Exchanged pics and it was a GO. I got nervous but had a weird wave of courage to go through with it. The hotel I stayed at was kinda fancy and you needed a room key to call for an elevator so I HAD to go down to the lobby to get the guy. I didn‚Äôt want to because of my nerves but I didn‚Äôt have a choice. So when he was close I went down and sat in the lobby. Terrified of everyone that was there and could see me. I know I looked passable but still felt like everyone had laser vision on me so I had my face hurried in my phone constantly. The security guard watched me closely and I swear never took eyes off of me. 

This is where the shittiness starts. I waited for like 10 minutes and then I heard the most humiliating whistle from across the lobby. The kind you use to get a dogs attention. Naturally I looked for who whistled and I saw ‚Äúmy guy‚Äù. It irritated me because I‚Äôm not a damn dog but a part of me accepted it because I wanted to be used  as a little sex toy so fine. Whatever. I get up and walk towards him and point to the elevators. Didn‚Äôt say anything to him and he followed me. He gets closer and says ‚Äúhey what‚Äôs up‚Äù while looking at me a little strange. I said hi and laughed a little saying that I was a little nervous. He stops in his tracks and says ‚Äúoh we aren‚Äôt doing this‚Äù and turns around as I stepped on the elevator. I was shocked and stopped him. I said that it‚Äôs fine and I‚Äôm okay. I though he sensed my nerves and didn‚Äôt wanna push me but I was fine!! But he looked at me kinda mad and said ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt with your voice‚Äù and just walked away‚Ä¶ I closed the elevator doors and just sat there in a trance..

Might not be a big deal to some but that wrecked me. I was in such a vulnerable state and I wasn‚Äôt ready for that at all‚Ä¶ he messaged me afterwards and was a real arrogant dick about it. ‚ÄúI thought you were a more committed crossdresser‚Äù and then he hits me with ‚ÄúI wish you could have just shut the fuck up and I would have fucked you‚Äù‚Ä¶ I told him that I literally would have been fine with that but it was never discussed. I‚Äôm a cross dresser, NOT trans. I‚Äôm still a guy so yeah my voice is normal. Not even a deep voice. THEN he asks if I wanted a video to watch him cum and I said fuck no, you pissed me off. He didn‚Äôt understand why either..

This slut forgot to mention in it's last post that it recently tested positive for you know what, and it's classes are all in-person learning, so it basically has all day every day to itself until it is negative.

***6:30am:*** Your whore woke up, got itself a cup of coffee (in a dog bowl, of course), and opened Reddit to check for assignments and tasks to complete throughout the day. The first rule it saw was:

>At least one of your holes must be filled at all times as long as you're awake.

If you're wearing panties they must be a size too small and must be pulled up in a tight frontal wedgie so it's running your clit.

If you're not wearing panties you must apply arousal gel of some sort once each hour.

This slut immediately got up and went to retrieve a medium-sized plug in order to comply with it's orders. After inserting the plug, it went and dug through it's underwear drawers in order to find some too-small panties. Luckily, it found two pairs that it had purchased to play with a while ago, and it plans to wear these two pairs exclusively until it is able to get more. This slut does not have any arousal gel, but it ordered some as well as some more small panties online (since it is not allowed to leave the house currently). It removed the tape it had been wearing over its clit, and put on the panties, pulling the front up as high as it could in between it's lips. Your whore will be wearing her wedgie during all waking hours from now on. Thank you for the orders u/Keiichi18.

***7:00am:*** Your whore made itself some breakfast, and ate it on the floor from it's bowl (this bitch is forbidden to use furniture, plates, and cutlery). Not long after finishing it's breakfast, this slut saw a new order had been commented on it's post:

>Edge 10 times in every room of your house. But you cant use the same method of edging twice. You can finger, then stuff yourself, then bondage and etc.

This whore's apartment has 4 main rooms: A bedroom, a bathroom, a living room, and a kitchen. it decided to start in the living room. (All items used were either sanitized or covered with a condom etc. before and after any kind of insertion - safety first always) This bitch completed its first edge with its fingers. Being able to finger itself after a long time alternating between long periods of no touch with intermittent short periods where this cunt managed to get permission to edge itself was such a glorious feeling. This cunt's living room edges went as follows:

1. Rubbing its clit with its fingers.
2. Riding a 7"" dildo on the floor.
3. Grinding on the armrest of the couch (not being permitted to use furniture, and only using it to enhance this slut's frustration is such a delicious mindfuck).
4. Fucking itself in the ass with a 6"" dildo.
5. Grinding on the corner of the coffee table while this whore's hands were tied behind its back.
6. Putting one of the couch pillows on the floor and humping it.
7. Fucking itself with the TV remote.
8. Pulling on the wedgie in its panties so that they rub its clit until this slut reached the edge.
9. Grinding on the windowsill (yes, the curtains were pulled back so the world could see, although I am on the 6th floor so probably not that visible).
10. Fucking itself with the handle of its Playstation controller.

***9:20am:*** Your slut took a short break to get some water, then went to the bathroom for another 10 edges:

1. Fucking itself with its toothbrush handle.
2. Rubbing its clit with a makeup brush.
3. Grinding against the toilet seat.
4. Grinding against the edge of the bathtub, with hands tied to a rope suspended from the shower curtain rod.
5. Using the showerhead.
6. Grinding against the towel holder.
7. Fucking itself in the ass with the toilet brush handle.
8. Grinding against an open cabinet door.
9. Fucking a 8"" suction cup dildo ""doggystyle"" in the shower.
10. Dangling a wand from the shower curtain rod, cuffing this cunt's hands to it, then trying to balance the dangling wand against this cunt's clit.

***10:30am:*** After all of that, your slut decided to gag itself, since it was getting harder and harder to keep quiet, and it didn't want to disturb its neighbors. With that done, this greedy whore moved on to its bedroom, where it edged by:

1. Humping its pillow.
2. Grinding against the door handle.
3. Bending over and grinding up and down the closet door.
4. Squatting over and only partially inserting a vibrating dildo (this slut's legs were BURNING).
5. Grinding against the bedframe.
6. Grinding against the armrest of the reading chair.\*\*
7. Grinding this whore's heel into it's cunt
8. Placing the 8"" suction cup dildo on the mirror and fucking this whore with it while the greedy whore choked on a 9"" dildo.
9. Humping one of this whore's nice shoes.
10. Laying facedown on the floor on top of a magic wand.

\*\* Between edges 6 and 7, this dirty whore pissed itself. It didn't think that it would be proper form to leave the bedroom before its task was finished, but couldn't hold it. Your slut didn't have any bottles or anything with it, so it ended up squatting down and pissing in a basket of gym clothes that it never got around to washing. This slut tossed them in the washing machine immediately after completing it's 10th edge.

***12:15pm:*** Your bitch decided to take a bit of a break from its around the world edge-a-thon, both because it was hungry and because it's greedy cunt was simultaneously begging for more and for this slut to stop, and this slut wasn't sure if it'd be able to keep itself from going over the edge without a bit of a break.

***1:00pm:*** Your whore finished her edging journey in the kitchen, its final 10 edges went like:

1. Fucking itself with a banana.
2. Fucking itself in the ass with a cucumber.
3. Grinding against the washing machine while it was running (this one came scarily close to sending your whore over the edge).
4. Standing on a chair, bending over, and grinding against the fridge handle.
5. Fucking itself in the ass with the handle of a serving spoon.
6. Grinding against the dryer while it was running (these machines are not to be fucked with, at least not if a whore is trying to stay denied)
7. Placing a 14"" dildo (this greedy whore's biggest one) on a chair, then squatting over it and going up and down (this cunt's legs were so burnt out after this one, the dildo was too big for this cunt to be able to sit down and relax, but not long enough that this cunt could stand up fully.)
8. Lying down on top of the kitchen table and fucking itself with a 7"" dildo.
9. Lying on top of the counter and using the faucet.
10. Grinding against a cereal box.

***2:45pm:*** It had been almost 8 hours since this dumb cunt started this task, and it was absolutely exhausted. This cunt made its way over to its spot on the floor in its room, set a timer for an hour, and fell asleep on the same pillow it had edged over just a few hours ago. Thank you to u/PM_mE_Ur_NakedBod for the orders.

***3:45pm:*** This slut woke up from its nap, and opened Reddit once again to look for new orders. It was given the following task:

>Spend an hour with a vibe taped to your clit. Your can turn it on and off, but when it's on, it should be at full power. Use a stopwatch to time how long it's off for, and afterwards spend that long kneeling on rice.

Your whore's cunt was already sore from being penetrated so much earlier, and its clit was sensitive to even the lightest touch. It wished it hadn't seen this task, especially after the last one, but a fucktoy's wishes don't matter.

Fucktoy did not do well with this task. It was unable to leave the vibrator on for more than maybe 10-15 seconds at a time at best, and a couple seconds at a time at worst. By the time the hour was up, this cunt's stopwatch read 47:23. The consequences for such a poor performance were extremely painful. This fucktoy chose a 50 minute porn video to use as a timer, turned it on, then got itself prepared by dumping the rice out on the ground and tying its hands behind its back. Fucktoy thought the porn would help distract it from the sharp rice, but in reality it only added another dimension to its suffering. This fucktoy is ashamed to admit that it broke down in tears about halfway through, but despite the pain still carried out its task to the end. Thank you to u/mc-fd for the orders.

***6:00pm:*** This bitch decided after it finished cleaning up from the last task that it would check Reddit once more before finalizing its report for the day. It came upon the following orders:

>Like a good fucktoy, you still need to please men even if you get nothing out of it.

Most men orgasm with 2-5 minutes of stimulation. Since you‚Äôre a piece of fuckmeat, you don‚Äôt need any foreplay but you still have a duty to be a useful set of holes.

At least once a day, fuck your pussy for 2-5 minutes without otherwise stimulating yourself. Set a timer and when it goes off just pull out abruptly and roll over unfulfilled and frustrated.

Fucktoy can't service anyone at the moment due to circumstances outside of it's control, so this task is perfect. This walking set of holes will put them to use immediately after waking up, and immediately before going to bed every day, as if it had a man to serve. Thank you to u/Myotheraccount7148 for the *orders.*

***This concludes fucktoy's 1st report. fucktoy humbly requests that you comment feedback and/or orders either here, or on it's original post. fucktoy promises to attempt any task within its limits that is commented. Once your task is complete, fucktoy will include it in a future report and notify you of it's completion.***",F37 [Update] Make This Whore Fail it's 365 Day Denial Pledge - Part 1,1.0,2.0

sckfd7,"Emma stared at her ceiling, eyes defocused as she laid motionless. She'd been awake for nearly twenty minutes, but just could not find the motivation to leave her bed. It was a Saturday, and she had no plans. Why should she have to ""get up,"" anyway?

She reached for her phone on her bed's side table, and lazily flicked her thumb across the screen to unlock it. Opening Instagram, she started scrolling through the infinite column of content. At the moment, most of it was food.

""Fuck,"" she groaned. She was hungry. Beautifully edited photos of sugar-dusted pastries and grilled meats dominated her timeline.

&#x200B;

*I guess the whole eating thing might be a good enough reason to get up*, she admitted to herself.

&#x200B;

She briefly wondered if her parents were going to make breakfast today. Probably not, if she didn't smell it already. She definitely couldn't con her sister into it either. She was so stressed about heading to college at the end of the summer, her sleep schedule was all over the place. She probably wasn't even awake yet.

&#x200B;

She closed her phone, and tossed it down on her bed. This was going to take a significant amount of mental energy to will herself from her soft, memory foam cocoon. Just as she was about to swing her legs over the side, she felt it. Out of nowhere, and without warning, she felt a touch. The sensation of a fingertip, maybe two, brushing against her clit.

&#x200B;

""What the *fuck*?"" Emma practically shouted. It stopped suddenly.

&#x200B;

Emma laid motionless, her breathing already faster from a slowly rising panic. Was it just some sort of phantom feeling? She'd read about conditions where the sensations of dreams could carry over to consciousness, but she'd never-

&#x200B;

She felt the fingers return to her clit, a little more boldly this time, rubbing her gently.

&#x200B;

Her heart in her throat, she tore off the comforter, and looked down at herself. She was wearing a white tank top, and a pair of loose dolphin shorts. She wasn't entirely sure was she was expecting to see, but she only saw herself. Still, the feeling persisted. It was getting stronger, rubbing her increasingly engorged nub with fervor.

&#x200B;

She quickly pulled her waistband open, and looked in her shorts. Nothing. Just her own, admittedly now a little wet, pussy. Her panic and incomprehension of the situation was the only thing holding back the surging arousal within her, if she was being honest. Her breath came out in short, ragged gasps, partly from her anxiety, and partly from the firm, skilled ministrations on her now quite erect clit.

&#x200B;

It was starting to get intense. The fingers, she guess they were fingers anyway, were really starting to go hard.

&#x200B;

*Fuck*, she thought, *this is insane, but damn that feels good...*

&#x200B;

She gripped her sheets tightly, her hips beginning to roll of their own accord. She bit her lip as she started to give in. The anxiety getting pushed to the back of her mind as the pleasure took the forefront of her attention. A soft moan escaped her lips while she rode the waves, letting the fingers do their thing. They picked up speed, moving in tight, constant circles, grinding against her, faster and faster.

&#x200B;

""Oh Fuck, God...,"" she whispered, her breath catching in her throat. She felt like release was within reach, but just narrowly escaping her. Frustration began to mount.

&#x200B;

Her thighs squeezed together tightly, while she continued to thrust, grinding against air. She could feel the prominent wet spot in her shorts, damp and slightly cold against her lips. She was soaked.

&#x200B;

*Oh Fuck, just let me cum*

&#x200B;

She teetered on the edge, unable to finish. She was getting desperate, balancing on a knife's blade between exquisite teasing and the ecstasy of climax. Then, just as it had began, it stopped completely. The invisible hands of her phantom lover were gone.

&#x200B;

""What...?"" she said weakly.

&#x200B;

*Damnit, no! I was so close!*

&#x200B;

She balled up her fists in frustration, her clit absolutely throbbing. She could feel her sex dripping viscous lubrication into her shorts. She was a teased up, ravenously horny mess.

&#x200B;

She tried to steady her breathing, calm her self down. As she tried to ignore the ramped up arousal pounding inside her, she her rustling through her wall.

&#x200B;

*Oh*, she thought absently, *I guess Teagan's up after all.*

&#x200B;

She heard what sounded like a drawer close. Then, a few moments later, the buzz of an electric motor. It was faint, but she could make it out.

&#x200B;

She had to stop herself from giggling, as a smile crept across her face.

&#x200B;

*Guess I'm not the only one who's horny this morning. She should really get a quieter vi-*

&#x200B;

Her thoughts were violently ejected from her head as a new sensation slammed into her. This time, not the gentle touch of fingers, but a strong vibration, centered directly on her already overstimulated clit. Electricity ripped through her body mercilessly as the electro-mechanical motions ground into her.

&#x200B;

She bit into her pillow, stifling a loud ""Oh, FUCK!"" as her whole body shook. This was it, she could feel it coming.

&#x200B;

It only took a few moments, and she felt that deep heat spike out from her pussy, as the first shockwave of her orgasm ricocheted through her frame. Then again, and again. The violent waves jerked her body, outside of her control, while she helplessly flailed as she came.

&#x200B;

After about 15 seconds or so, the feeling subsided. In her hazy state, barely able to perceive anything but the satisfaction of her twitching, sweaty body, she noticed the buzzing next door had stopped.

&#x200B;

Suddenly, her mind snapped back to lucidity.

&#x200B;

*No*, she thought, *It couldn't be.*

&#x200B;

She sat up, slowly, her pussy still throbbing. She took a few breaths, then put her feet over the side of the bed. Just then, she heard Teagan's door. She leapt up, nearly losing her balance from the sudden headrush, and flung her own door open. There she was, in the hallway, her impressively long ginger curls cascading down her back, wearing a mis-matched hello kitty t-shirt and flannel pajama bottoms. Teagan had her hand on the bathroom door handle, and in her other hand was a small, rounded, pink object.

&#x200B;

Her crystal blue eyes shot wide when she saw Emma, putting it behind her back. She then pushed the door in, and slammed it behind her. After a few seconds, all Emma heard was the water being run in the sink.

&#x200B;

Emma's eyebrows knitted in thought. Could it really be...?

&#x200B;

She shuddered a little, feeling the cold wetness in her shorts from her dripping sex. She needed to clean herself up.","[PI] A young woman, still living at home, wakes up with a new gift: She can personally feel all the physical sensations of anyone near her experiencing sexual pleasure.",2.0,2.0

* Anyone creating a post about the protest who does not have a significant history with this sub will be **banned**, no questions asked. If you do have a history with this community, the post will be removed and you will be warned.
* This community is about OTTAWA, not Covid nor the related restrictions. Remember that.

I'm at least 10 years the younger of everyone in my current workplace, yet by far one of the most effective workers. I'm paid according to my age instead of according to the cost of labour and it's wrong. Time and time again my boss has expressed the whole ""if you don't make enough money, work another job/work harder"" mentality and it's sickening. I told him I was struggling to make ends meet one month and he offered me an extra half hour a day at flat rate. Believe me, the business can afford to compensate us better, I've seen the takings.

The new position I have lined up pays significantly more an hour and demands less hours a week, even comes with genuine, real-world benefits. If my current boss wants to keep me and my contacts around then he'll need to cough up. Either way, he'll be footing more money for a different person to come in and take my place or be paying me a living wage, so it's about whether he values me as an employee, right?

But I'm sick of working for a poverty wage. I don't think I'm owed much, but I deserve more than this.

Sorry for the rant but things might be looking up now that I've got this bastard over a barrel and I've only got this sub to thank.","My boss pays me like crap and treats me like a child, tomorrow I'm going to give him an ultimatum; match the pay I've been offered from another job or accept my notice.",2.0,2.0

s4hfa2,,"How do you describe someone who‚Äôs being moody? Being from Yorkshire, I‚Äôd say ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve got monk on‚Äù. My wife, from another part of Yorkshire would say ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve got a cob on‚Äù. I‚Äôm just wondering what interesting regional variations there are?",,
rtwvea,"I'm 35, and have been a physician for 12 years. I was kind of ""guided"" into this career by my parents who were quite devout Christians. I was always a bright kid. taught myself some computer programming languages as a youngster and I always wanted to be a software engineer. 

Age 17 preparing for university my parents told me God's plan was for me to be a doctor. They were having visions from God this was the case etc. Being in a strict religious environment I didn't have much ability to think for myself, so I went on and studied medicine. I enjoyed the science aspect and I would have thought back then I was a people person.

After University I struggled with a lot of anxiety and worry about patients. I often would come home from work and worry about patients. I lost contact with a lot of my friends because I didn't have energy to socialise outside work. I felt my continued patient interaction at work ""zapped"" all my social energy, there was none left for friends. Over the last 12 years I've lost a lot of friends and relationships. 

I thought ""in time"" my ability to handle the stress and get work/life balance would improve as I gained more experience and confidence. It's now 12 - (TWELVE!!) years on and I feel much the same. I worry about patients off duty. I have no social energy to meet people after work. I come home, sift through results and update patient files on the computer and then go to bed. I hate living this way, but it is all I know.

I've cut my working week down to 3 days a week, it's the same though. Stressed at work, anxious at home. No friends. No social life. I'm disappointed because I'd like to work 5 days a week in a job I love - yet here I am struggling at 3. I feel like I could be better utilised in another role in society where I can give my all.

Financially I feel like I could achieve more if I did 5 days a week work. Currently at 3 days a week, after work and vacation/retirement savings are deducted I am left with about $75K USD per year in income. I can't help but wonder if I could earn similar in a less stressful job, or earn more by working full time, say in software engineering.

Also, patients have become very hostile towards my profession. I'm abused daily. Mostly mean comments, some physical aggression. 

I can't see the point in me staying anymore. I have friends in other fields who have no on call work, aren't dealing with emotionally heavy life/death stuff, get lunch breaks, and don't have to deal with people and are on 150K plus salaries annually. I've know 4 of my colleagues who have quit medicine or various practices the last 3 months. I feel like in general healthcare workers are getting fed up.

Is it normal to feel this way, still, after being in a job for 12 years? Is the job the problem or is it me/my personality? 

Should I risk leaving completely and retrain in software enginnering? I've got savings, but I don't own a house or have other major assets. I worry if I quit/retrain now that I will use all my house savings to retrain again and I'll be even unhappier in 5 years and should have just stayed where I am? I just don't know which way to go. Any advice on what I should do, books I should read for Info/insight?",I'm 35. Physican for 12 years. Always stressed & worried about patients off duty. I've almost no friends due to no social energy. Assumed anxiety/stress would improve with experience - but feel the same for 12 years. Covid now means abusive patients. Do I quit? Retrain?

ru0zbc,"I worked for a crystal boutique company that has multiple locations in Colorado and Maine. I was the gm for their Portland me location. Worked for them for 2.5 months. In those 2.5 months, they attempted to break labor laws and wanted me to work unpaid overtime, they did not ever provide time for a break or lunch (this was full time), they paid me 8 days late for one of my paychecks, the supervisor above me belittled degraded and found confrontation anywhere she could. 

The last straw: they had their inventory audit on New Year‚Äôs Eve. I prepped for over a month for this audit, pre counting inventory(which is all entered and tracked manually through Shopify, no barcodes or scanning just brute force counting/entry), organizing the back room which was a complete disaster with random shit everywhere and nearly no system to organizing, and working diligently with no breaks while also being the only salesperson to help customers during the holidays. 

Come inventory day. We are short staffed because one employee had quit due to the disrespect she‚Äôd received from my supervisor. 3 people to count thousands of items individually and manually enter. We were scheduled for 8 hours. One of the staff left after the 8hours and me and one other staff stayed for 12 hours attempting to finish the inventory. After 12 hours, with nothing but a quick break to eat, me and my associate needed to go home to eat dinner and rest.  

I was met with so much passive aggression from my supervisor I can‚Äôt Even begin to describe it. She (my supervisor) ended up staying for 2 more hours after I‚Äôd left and worked on inventory (unpaid btw) The next day they fired me and claimed I was ‚Äúabsent, did not perform my job duties, and had careless and shoddy work‚Äù. 

I have videos and a lot of proof (texts etc) of their misconduct but idk if I even have a lawsuit case here in Maine. Holy fuck I‚Äôve been in a bad streak of jobs for the past 3 years. Idk if it will ever get better. Thanks for reading

TLDR; worked as hard as I could with no breaks, got fired for working a 12 hour shift instead of a 14 hour shift.


Edit: they sent me a fucking cease and desist email! And wrote a bunch of lies on their google reviews saying I damaged product and screamed when they fired me which is not true I didn‚Äôt even yell maybe slightly raised my voice lmao. Fuck these assholes so much

Update: I can‚Äôt express how grateful I am to the Reddit army for sticking up for me. It‚Äôs so validating and all the support is helping me get through this.

So just wanted to let everyone know that he and the several other bilingual folks on his team did get their raise AND back pay! Mgmt caved pretty quickly too, he went back to work Monday and didn't hear anything,  but by Thursday HR had emailed him and the team to let them know they were fixing the ""oversight"".  

THEN HR sent an email to all employees in the company letting them know that in order to stay competitive w the market, they would offer an ""advanced"" Spanish test for a total of $3 raise.  

Can't say 100% my husband was responsible for this overhaul,  but we think he was.   So, hell yeah,  change is possible!




Original post:  My husband has been at a call center doing customer service for about 8 months.  The deal at that company is that if you take 3 Spanish classes (Three 4hr refresher coarses to learn how to speak business-lingo in Spanish), and pass the quiz then you get a $2 raise. When he was hired he was told the classes would be given in a span of three weeks.

When he started, the instructor was on vacation or something so they didn't offer him the first class until about 6 weeks of him being there, all the while he's been taking *mostly* Spanish calls.  He finally took the first and second classes, but the instructor has failed to schedule the third class... for months now... and all the while my husband has been expected to take Spanish calls.   

He's so fed up bc he's basically been doing uncompensated labor for 8 months. His team lead and his boss brush him off, the instructor won't return his emails.   So he decided that he's no longer going to do it and started to divert all Spanish calls to another team member or voicemail. He warned his boss yesterday that if he didn't get his raise and back pay then he'd stop taking the calls and I guess they called his bluff.  

Well the big problem for his employer is that basically all the other Spanish speakers that are not being compensated decided to do the same, a mini strike! 

All day my husband's been on the phone w HR, his lead, his boss, his boss's boss.  Everyone calling to chew him out, or convince him to ""be a team player"" and continue taking calls without a raise. His lead saying she is totally on his side but can he do this for her as a favor (yeah right!).

We'll see what happens next week,  but I'm willing to bet that they WILL BE promptly paying all the Spanish speakers and giving them back pay.","Husband was refused the ""Spanish-speaking"" raise at his job so he stopped taking Spanish calls.

Well tonight I got an enthusiastic response from a lady who said she wanted to transition off app to text. I obliged and we began texting, now mind you I‚Äôm not a total moron (maybe I am), this whole time I had an idea something might be off.

ry6o16,"Edit: the bad faith have downvoted but not commented. You want change but won't listen to someone who only plays attacker 90 percent of the time. 


This was done on my cellphone so bear with me on grammar. I'm not a genius, I just play this game a lot. I don't like playing defense unless I'm with friends and here's why

Torn banner has intentionally made it easier to be an attacker and here's some reasons why. Defense can still win if they can stay focus but most of the time they don't until the last phase. Almost every maps objective is made for the attacking side to advance. 

Most objectives give the offense two points to push yet we only need one to make it. This makes the Defense get burdened with defending both or they lose. It should be on the offense to get both points to their spots, if youre gonna give us two points to push. A team can just flat out ignore one and flood the other to achieve the objective, makes no sense. Bandages are infinite so for most attackers when we get hurt, we fall back and stock up and return to the lines. Defenders do this and are basically forced to abandoned their lines, everything should be done to limit that. Firepots absolutely destroy any attempt to form defensive lines or control a choke point, simply just throw it, players can get firepots so easily too and it gets spammed. I feel like so many maps just leave the defense stretched out and not enough info is given on where to be, it's easy to take advantage of those shortcomings. 

Defensive class equipment is a joke. Spike traps take one Messer overhead to break and a two minute timer which is a joke too, it's just a ramp for attackers to use to get over things. The barriers are okay but they should be great to use. Encourage people by buffing them. Engineers with health packs sometimes don't heal who we want, so a player who is fighting bravely on the defensive lines who needs health badly might get screwed out. I don't know how many times I see a guy who im trying to heal and some dudes runs by and gets healed for 8 health. Make them just land on the ground and have a AOE effect like in battlefield games. Make banners reinforced defensive structures via an AOE mechanic, this encourages knights and engineers to work together. If I'm a knight and see spike traps than I know where to drop my banner, make them heal players faster too, it takes way too long when I can just go find the infinite loot chest. Still need to buff engineer structures  health, remove timers and give them double the amount of structures. Also anyone on defense should get 2x or 3x times the points than a player on offense gets, for players who want to level up this will encourage them to play defense. 

Footman class have inferior weaponry to control 1vX. Poles are slow and less dmg. One handers lack range and dmg for defensive stalling. It takes a Coordinated effort to make these weapons work. Give them access to all the weapons..

Spawns in Many areas give the advantage to attacking side. Some maps the defenses gets absolutely screwed on. 

Console players need to see chat. It can get toxic but that communication ability can be imperative.

Some objectives requires just a button tap to engage like the galencourt gate area and some objectives require only 8 hits to destroy like in falmires phase before the bridge. 

Torn banner wants all the new players to experience the game to the last phase to hook them in. It seems to be when most people finally get it and pitch in to help. Im not saying defensive wins don't happen but we all know they are extremely hard to achieve. I've seem some doozies after getting to rank 648

Most of the time I can just lure people away by running around to bait and my teammates who's job it is to advance can rush the now open ground. I can't tell how many times I get behind a team and they have guards for their archer off objective, it's hilarious and just another example of people giving priority to the wrong thing.

My style of play to sneak, be aggressive and flank but since Torn banner has made desertion zones I'm limited on defense to where I can go. They also have punished players by restricting what you can do like throw weapons in desertion modes. It just forces players to give up ground that they don't have too, defense is all about stalling attackers until the timer is out, this gives the advantage to attackers.

All of this has created a game where people to choose to play attack because it's more fun. Torn banner needs to implement better changes",Attacking is easier. The defense needs help. Here are my opinions.,2.0,2.0

However, people are painting it out like Nate manipulated her into having sex with him. I‚Äôm confused on how they came to that conclusion for many reasons:

1) It‚Äôs clear she was a bit tipsy, but she was still able to have a somewhat serious conversation with Nate outside their gas station. If a random person came up to her to talk, I highly doubt they would of thought she was intoxicated.
2) Nate did not once verbally flirt with her. It‚Äôs true that we was giving her lustful glances, but I‚Äôm not sure how him drinking while driving, going over the speed limit, and looking at her would ‚Äúmanipulate‚Äù her into taking off her panties.
3) It would be one thing if they had sex in the car. In fact, I would be a little more sympathetic to her as it would‚Äôve been an impulsive decision that came from being inebriated and he just happened to be a person in the moment she could sleep with. But the fact that they went ALL the way inside the house to fuck shows that she was aware of what was going on and had plenty of time to think about what she did beforehand. 
4) The exaggeration of how drunk she was is thrown out the window when she immediately registered Maddie‚Äôs voice and started crying. If she was truly as drunk as people say, she would‚Äôve continued on.

I was recently called out on another subreddit by what I assume were straight men, who obviously have no idea how many sex partners an average single gay man has (or can have).

After all, as most of you probably know, a single night at a sex club can result in sexual interactions of all sorts (jo, bj, anal) with dozens of men. 

When you add up occasional visits to sex clubs/ bath houses, plus some cruising here and there, as well as regular weekly hookups through apps... then you multiply that by 10, 20, 30 or more years of an active sex life... 

Well, it can easily run into thousands of men, literally!!!

No bragging, no judging. Just an honest question for my fellow gay men >30.

rxetnw,"I find it very odd that we never ask women to be with a man who made them feel undesirable and ""settled"" for. The vast majority of women would not feel comfortable being with a man whom they knew loved his ex more or was more attracted to her than them and was far more willing to commit to her but is only with them because she is more attainable and provides them with stability and children. I have a lot of empathy for a woman in that situation and I would see it as completely understandable that she would not want to be with such a man. The fact that so many promiscuous women here resort to shaming and gaslighting instead of showing basic empathy strikes me as highly manipulative. I don't think the majority of people would want to be in a relationship with someone who'd lie to them and shame them for having basic emotions. I find it interesting how so many women's response is to basically say ""stop being insecure"" instead of trying to make their partner feel more attractive or finding someone they feel is on par with their previous partners.

I think if we're being completely honest with ourselves, the main reason why many of us engage in sex and relationships is to feel attractive and desired. This is the main reason why men choose to dumpster-dive on dating apps rather than seek out a much more attractive escort with far less effort. This is the basis of the entire relationship. If either partner feels their partner is ""settling"" for them or sees them as a downgrade, then the whole relationship will likely fall apart very quickly. One might argue that ""we all settle"" in relationships. I would respond by saying that we only settle if our goal is to get the hottest and highest-status person possible barring all other considerations. If our goal instead is to get someone we're very attracted to and sees us as an equal and cares for us, then the majority of us don't need to settle.","If you're going to tell men to feel comfortable with being the stable option, you must be willing to be the stable option yourself.",2.0,2.0

He was really nice and told me I could touch for 5 minutes!
5 minutes later, he told me to stop touching but I didn‚Äôt listen and made myself cum instead. It was an accident because I was so turned on, I lost control. I made myself cum 2 or 3 more times before starting my day.
Halfway through my day, I felt really guilty so I texted him to tell him that I broke the rules and he was really angry at me. I didn‚Äôt let it slip til much later that I broke them a few times.
As punishment, he had me sit on the floor beneath him and write ‚ÄúI am Daddy‚Äôs obedient little whore and Daddy owns me completely‚Äù 50 times in a row. Later, he made me apologize on my knees and repeat that mantra with his dick down my throat.
He told me I was weak for not being able to make it more than a few hours without cumming and that since I broke the rules, I‚Äôm not allowed to cum for 3 days. He was really nice and let me hump his leg for a bit, let me rub my clit for 2 whole minutes, and he even rubbed my pussy for a few seconds himself.

qsi11j,"We're all super excited for the re-launch of G4, but realize also there's a lot of questions on how and where to watch it. G4 will be **streamed online**, but also available on **traditional cable**, which is a bit of a new concept, so below we have some FAQs on how to get your G4 fix.

With this hybrid format, every minute of G4's original programming will be streamed **live** on Twitch/YouTube.

Linear is going to be a bit of a ""soft launch"" because it'll constantly lag 1 day behind live streaming.

GOING FORWARD, anything that's on live stream on Wednesday will likely air on Thursday on linear, and so on and so forth. So no matter if you have cable or not, your eyeballs/earholes still have full access to G4.

\*\*This FAQ will be updated as more info becomes available\*\*

**Q: Which Cable Providers Carry G4?**

Currently announced cable providers include:

* **Verizon Fios**
* **Cox**
* **Xfinity TV**

More providers will be announced in the coming days/weeks, and deals can even close post-launch. Keep an eye on the website link below for the most up-to-date list.

**Q: Which streaming providers carry G4?**

The linear version of G4 will be available on **Philo** at launch.

More providers will be announced in the coming days/weeks, and deals can even close post-launch. Keep an eye on the website link at the bottom of this post for the most up-to-date list of providers. YouTube and Twitch will also carry live streams of G4's **original** shows as they are aired/produced.

**Q: What is G4's channel number on cable/streaming?**

These can vary from location to location - for example the channel number for Xfinity in Philadelphia may not be the same as the channel number for Xfinity in Houston, so check with your local carrier for your exact channel number.

**Q: Is there a schedule where I can see what's airing?**

You can see when G4 shows like AOTS, Boosted, X-Play and Invitation to Party will go live on Twitch/YouTube over at G4's schedule page: [https://g4tv.com/schedule](https://g4tv.com/schedule) Additionally, G4's been doing a number of test shows, and side shows on Twitch/YouTube that won't necessarily appear on  cable. Look for them on the schedule page above - but sometimes these are a bit impromptu and just may happen before/after schedule streams as a lead in or lead out.

For the cable channel schedule, there's a blog post on [g4tv.com](https://g4tv.com) that will be updated weekly with here: [https://g4tv.com/blog/tv-schedule](https://g4tv.com/blog/tv-schedule) 

Or you can check your cable provider's channel guide (or third party sites like TV Guide, Zap2It).

**Q: What if my cable or streaming provider doesn't carry G4?**

No worries, you can still feast from the G4 buffet via Twitch and YouTube and see every episode of Attack of the Show, X-Play, Boosted and more!

Alternatively, you could also contact your local cable provider and request that they carry G4 in the future.

**Q: What if I live outside the United States?**

You can still watch G4 content and live streams via the YouTube and Twitch channels, just like us yankees.

More providers will be announced in the coming days/weeks, and deals can even close post-launch. So keep an eye on the website link below for the most up-to-date list of providers.

**\*\*For the most up-to-date info on where to watch, check this page on G4's official website:** [**https://g4tv.com/blog/what-is-g4**](https://g4tv.com/blog/what-is-g4) **\*\***

BONUS FAQS:

**Q: Who are the hosts?**

**Attack of the Show -** Kevin Pereira, Gina Darling, Kassem G, Fiona Nova, and Will Neff

**Boosted -** Ovilee May, Alex ‚ÄúGoldenboy‚Äù Mendez, and Froskurinn

**Xplay -** Adam Sessler, The Black Hokage, Frosk and Jirad the  Completionist

**Invitation to Party -** B. Dave Walters, Kassem G, Fiona Nova, Ify Nwadiwe, and Froskurinn

**Q: Is there an official G4 merch store?**

Yes! Check out shop.g4tv.com to browse G4 branded merch items, the G4 x Champion collab (limited time pre-orders!), cute Bongo Cat shirts and tchotchkes, and (coming soon) show-specific merch! Keep an eye on both the website & the merch site for all sorts of sweet drops.

However, there is an even more toxic and inhuman group on the rise, the toxic feminist types who like to bully men simply for being alone and generalizing all of them as incels. What a lot of them have in common is that they like to continually humiliate, bully and embarass them for their situation, yet doing absolutely nothing to educate or change them and their beliefs. What's worse, this is normalized from my experience. It's almost as if they see this sharp division between them such that they see certain men as if they are not even human, just objects waiting to be kicked around and objectified.

So.. you're mad because someone has multiple posts that people *chose* to like?

You're really that mad and sensitive at the fact someone posts relevant content to multiple subreddits, so they could share the content they seen with multiple communities so they could enjoy it too.. why? What does someone else's account have to do with you? What does someone else's karma have to do with you? Why does it matter if the person has 10 karma points or a thousand? How and why does that dictate the quality of content posted? Why does that dictate someone's worth?

People love to say karma is pointless, karma doesn't matter, but then be the biggest bitchers and complainers when it comes to someone being a ""karma whore"". People love to say karma doesn't matter but be the biggest downvoters. Lol. 
If it don't matter, why go out of your way to worry about it and someone else's? 

This whole idea of being a karma whore is stupid. This whole idea of banning/deleting someone because they have a lot of karma is stupid. Reddit puts so much emphasis on karma in its subreddits yet they hate people that actually get it. 

If the person is posting *relevant* content to the subreddit while following the subreddits rules, why hate them for what they personally choose to do? Their karma has no affect on anybody else. Period. It isn't like they scammed or conned the karma either; they are literally free upvotes that people *choose* to give... so you're hating someone because people chose to upvote content that they like?

Don't be mad because someone posts something to multiple subreddits. There's nothing wrong with posting things to multiple subreddits that could enjoy the content instead of hoarding it to one subreddit. People really hate others because they are being social, active and interacting with an assortment of subreddits instead of just two. 

And honestly a lot of the time the people hating have little karma and are just feeling petty and jealous because you post things people actually like while they sit at 20k for 2 years ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Like quit hating on people because they have free and ultimately pointless internet points that people chose to give because they enjoyed the content shared. Quit acting victim because someone posted content to your subreddit that people enjoy. Who gives a fuck if it's been posted to other subreddits? How does it affect you, your account or your life? The whole point of Reddit is to be a social media so quit hating on people being social. It just seems like an ignorant thing to hate on when you have people in these subreddits sharing negativity and being hateful. Go worry about them and not someone just trying to share content. Be happy someone posted in your subreddit at all. Period. 

People really gotta start minding their own business and really looking at themselves and the shit they be hating on. Who cares if someone has 500k karma? Good for them. That doesn't affect me or their content at all. It doesn't change whether the content is good or enjoyable. It doesn't change anything. And the person with the karma? Karma is ultimately pointless. Hating on someone because of free internet points is stupid and petty. They can't do anything with the karma to begin with so quit hating someone for having it. It isn't like someone is getting all this karma and getting paid for it. It isn't like the person is taking karma away from someone else (karma has an unlimited supply, it isn't some economic situation). There's plenty of free karma to go around for everybody so being petty because someone has a lot of it is pointless. 

Again quit worrying about some imaginary number. If anything having a large amount of karma is a good thing; it shows the person is active, being social, engaging with and helping communities while also posting content people obviously enjoy, opposed to the countless profiles that just post BS people don't like at all. 

There's other things, other people and better people to be mad about it instead of something posting shit people like and choose to upvote. It just seems Reddit had a backwards view on a lot of things and then pointlessly/excessively get mad about others. It is what it is. It's reddit. Just wanted to post this rant.

So this gets a little complicated because I am pretty sure this is a fantasy bag. Here is the actual [Le Cagole Small Shoulder Bag in Black](https://www.balenciaga.com/en-us/le-cagole-small-shoulder-bag-black-6713071VG9Y1000.html) from the Balenciaga website. Here is a [RLe Cagole Red XS Shoulder Bag in Red Floral Print](https://www.neimanmarcus.com/p/balenciaga-cagole-floral-print-studded-shoulder-bag-prod245580176) from Neiman Marcus. I actually realize I sent Aaron an image from [another counterfeit website](https://www.lorients.com/brand/balenciaga?page=32) without knowing. Now I'm feeling slightly hesitant I'm getting the Black S instead of the Red XS because the bag I'm getting doesn't exist. But maybe it doesn't matter? Should I give him the green light to ship?

I'm purchasing two bags from Aaron. This Le Cagole and a [Fornasetti NeoNoe](https://stockx.com/louis-vuitton-x-fornasetti-neonoe-mm-black-white). I'll post the Neonoe photos as soon as he sends them.

Is he holding his gut in or wearing a corset?

rukenx,"Hi has a closet sissy i tend to overthink about which life should i take, i try to find a reason for me to have failed as a man and why did i embrace the sissy world.  
Yesterday i came with an answer to my thoughts maybe some of you will relate to these.

I think i am sissy because i am such a beta that i know i cant score with beautiful or powerful girls and maybe if i was able to have something with a girl i would cum to soon and my penis size is average but its always a shame when girls start to compare. Because of all that i revenged my anger on porn specially those where there was female degradation, big cock but it started to loose effect i need more the thing with porn is that you are not the one fucking but you watch porn because you fuck lol. 

In order to achieve more i guess i started to dress up, disclaimer when i was little i dressed up sometimes on my mothers clothes but guys we are children that doesn't count we spend more times with our mothers we see them dressing up of couse when we start to gain some capabilities we start to imitate them because we are not yet used to gender rules i guess, i dressed up most in lingerie and i usually go for the sluttiest outfits and yes i want to be a girl and fuck man every night. 

oh wait do i really want this ???

if i had the power to have any female body would i live as woman and marry a man and have children? no , would i marry a girl ? maybe, but if instead of girls body i could have a male body ? maybe that was a better option. these questions are not suited for all this was for my case and i know that there are people that thing the same as me 

so why do you keep trying to be a better sissy and not a better confident man ?

well because i am too weak for that being a sissy is the easiest path its just us and our goals i am not saying it is easy but compared to the other option it is the only difficult thing is to tell to our love ones and must of us dont do that because we are weak, we keep dressing up because porn wasn't enough but i still want to fuck women but i am no man for that so i became one and i do to me the things i wish i did to them, i dress slutty, i humiliated and degrade myself, i want to be whore, i want to fuck the biggest dildos, i want to be gang banged by men. All these because when i look in the mirror is not me whose there but the girl that i wish i was fucking thats why our goals are perfect women, women that make us hard.

What we do is no different from porn we dress, fuck, cum, moan just like them we imagine the same scenario but these time we are not wanking to the screen we are the scene and we play all roles.

At these moment i can only reproduce how a real girl would masturbate and sometimes picture how she would play on the real scenario with a man, maybe one day a will have the courage and do it with a real cock because i just want to see these girl reacting to the cock not the man because that man is me and the cock i am sucking is mine   


Hi sorry for my english and my language i got a bit excited writing these maybe it got a bit confusing but i hope you are able to understand","am i really a sissy? and are you really one? or after all the feminization, hypnos and anal i was all these time a man that was not lucky enough?",1.0,2.0

[you kind of need to pick a strategy that works for your emotions, available time, capital levels and go with it.  Practice trades don't work as well as just making the trade every day with small size.    I languished for a long time moving from furu to furu, listening to everyone else's winning strategies that didn't work for me.  I had to shut all of that down and come up with my own approach to be successful.  My approach now is that I trade TSLA calls/puts every morning at the opening bell.  I wait for pre-market highs/lows to be broken, let the price come back to the pre-market line you drew (buy on the retracement), then wait for 1 or 2 pops and market sell on the pops.    This approach works for me because 1) I know TSLA really well and have been trading/investing in it for about 7 years, 2) I have a day job and I can be done with trading by 9:35 each morning.  I usually take the trade around 9:31 or 9:32 and I'm out in 30 seconds to a minute.  Holding an option you bought at open any longer than that is a terrible idea and you'll get murdered on spreads and decreased volume the further you get away from open. I have about an 80% win rate doing this and I keep my risk mgmt to roughly 1:1.   the key for me was to practice this trade a lot, every morning for months.  Then made a rule that once I started trading it I HAD to make the trade...every morning...every time it set up for me.  Even if I lost, I closed down and had to come back and do it again the next day.  After doing this, I was able to take the emotions out of the trade and calmly take the trade each day and control my emotions - cut the trade if I'm wrong and take profit when it was given to me.  Both are incredibly important.  TL/DR: find yourself 1 strategy you're comfortable with and work it, refine it, and get to where you can make this trade every time it sets up with no emotions.  Every other strategy, anything else someone online says, forget about it.](/r/Daytrading/comments/s2wppb/its_been_5_years_learning_taking_online_courses/hshyl5n/)

[I didn't see it preforming quite this bad, but during peak hype in early 2021 I explicitly warned people here that it was likely a bad idea to invest in ARK at that point in time. Like you I got a lot of dismissive responses. People really believed her active management approach would allow her to outperform regardless of market conditions.  Honestly I've been surprised at just how bad her calls have been this year. I run a similarish strategy to Cathie Wood in that I invest almost entirely in growth stocks within the innovation space and I've done alright this last year. The fact ARKK is down so much imo is a product of Cathie's extreme optimism which prevents her from managing risk appropriately. She's recklessly bullish which might be a good strategy in strong bull markets, but otherwise this is the expected result. Frankly her 2019 $4,000 call on TSLA was stupid and only seems smart in hindsight. And after she was proved right, she continued to double down and only got more bullish on TSLA. She should have sold the position entirely and put it into less loved places.  That said, I think some of her stocks are really oversold at this point. I'm not investing in ARKK, but recently I have been looking through her holdings and picking out some names I like. Threads like this and ETFs like SARK suggest to me there is a kind of reverse FOMO going on at this point. I suspect many of her stocks will see a decent bounce in 2022.

[I am actually quite bullish on Tesla *the company* (see below however for my views about TSLA the stock).  Tesla benefits from a major tailwind given that the West is politically determined to accelerate the conversion of passenger cars to EV. When viewed in isolation, their growth numbers are stellar (for a car company) and they are (mostly) executing along the expected trajectory. So far, they have seemed largely immune to the chip and other supply chain shortage issues that have pestered Ford, GM and others. Led by a charismatic (say what you will about Elon) founder, they have been terrifically successful in using the capital markets to their benefit (raising tens of billions of dollars at market highs). There's no question that they are a much better company than your average auto manufacturer and (outside of the fact that they are in a fundamentally lousy business) could be one of the best companies in the world. Yes, there's a lot of hype and BS (Cybertruck, semis, robotaxis, AI, robots, etc.) and even some quality and other issues, but the cars have a lot of demand and this will continue to be so (and they will continue to execute on being able to fill that demand for quite some time).  Now, to your second point about market share and profitability.  I wrote this quote from Terry Smith on another thread just now:  >‚ÄúAs Jim Chanos, the renowned short seller, observed ‚ÄòThe worst thing that can happen to reopening stocks is that we reopen.‚Äô It is often better to travel hopefully than to arrive.‚Äù  By extension, the worst thing that can happen to the Tesla stock is that they actually get to 20 million cars annually.  IMO, the stock is 100% a ""trading sardine"" at this point. Yes, they are not a traditional car company, margins are slightly better (and could still improve somewhat), etc. But there's just no way the $1T market cap (which is even higher fully diluted) is or ever will be justified. Yes, it's true that nobody knows what industries and areas they will venture out to etc. but that's just the same old price-driven narrative seen so many times before in times like 1999 etc. The stock is held by:  - traders / speculators / shills who are holding to sell at profit to less sophisticated investors - unsophisticated retail investors who just know the story and are completely price indifferent (just poll your friends and relatives and you'll know what I mean) - cult fanatics (like Jason DeBolt) who are either also price indifferent or have intentionally blocked off intellectual honesty when it comes to valuation work  As a side note, I am bullish on stocks and am currently 100% invested in US stocks in my PA. However, I just finished reading ""The Great Crash, 1929"" and I cannot overstate how many parallels there are to today and EVs and the Tesla stock. Human behavior, will never change.](/r/stocks/comments/s37fo3/what_is_the_bull_case_for_tesla_from_here/hsj416d/)

[The bull case is that they grow into their multiple. It will take 5 years of growth consistent with current historical run rates, but if done the stock can be seen as reasonably priced rn with little to no debt and a strong fixed asset base (ie factories). Ford, on the other hand, has a history of false starts and even if successful with EVs has a massive amount of debt; union issues; etc.  A good comparison for TSLA imo is Amazon. For years investors snubbed the stock because they thought the multiple was too high and earnings too low. What they missed was that Amazon was pouring the majority of profits into R&D, which eventually paid off in a big way.  Math - TSLA earnings in 2021 = 3.50/sh doubled each year for five years = $56, which puts the forward mutiple at 20 (1100 stock price/56). 20 multiple not too bad for a growth stock imo.](/r/stocks/comments/s37fo3/what_is_the_bull_case_for_tesla_from_here/hsksxk1/)

[TSLA      High risk high reward type srock there, personally i wouldn't invest in this company but thats based of gut feeling nothing else. VOO      Good, safe pick. This is one of the gold standards for investing. QQQM      Don't know much about this one, but the expense ratio is high. I would not buy into this one myself. AAPL      Another solid one, but keep an eye on it. Fundementals are great for this company but market cap (total value if the company) makes my head spin. MNRA     This is one I'm strongly bearish on, unless you bought sub-200 I would not buy more or hold onto it. UNH     No opinion. F     My favorite on this list. Ford has really turned themselves around over the past 5 years particularly over the past 12 months. Just keep up to date on any production short falls the company may experience as some have popped up recently. BRK.B     It's fun to say you own some of the most popular investment company. Great fundementals and solid historic growth, a safe good buy. MSFT     Yep, also good. As an added bonus market cap for microsoft is half of Apple's allowing for more valuation growth. NVDA     Watch me start a flame war. NVDA is the 2nd worst semi contuctor company to buy. If you have high risk appitite go for AMD. For a more conservative investment go for INTC. COST     Solid defensive play. This will, however, under preform the market. QCOM     Neutral standing. QCOM is expanding outside of phone chips/processors but geowth for the company appers limited.   Overall, a nice portfolio.

[One more thing that makes owning individual stocks cooler and more fun than boring old ETFs: voting rights!  If you own whole (not fractional) shares in most cases you have voting rights as a shareholder in the company. That means you are entitled to attend the annual shareholder's meeting where the company executives appear and answer to the shareholders. You can vote on proposals that require shareholder approval. Before COVID the meetings were in person but now they are mostly virtual. Someday they might go back to being in person.   So say you owned whole shares of TSLA (I own 25 shares of TSLA BTW. I used to own more but I stupidly sold some in early 2019 pre-split. What an idiot!). So as a shareholder of Tesla you could participate in the shareholder's meeting and ask Elon Musk why he is wasting company resources on Bitcoin, or anything else company-related you wanted to ask. Here's a video of Elon taking a question from a shareholder:  https://youtu.be/Z-_MnTd9TFc  How cool would that be? Especially if you prefaced your question by mentioning you are a (by then) 15-year-old Tesla shareholder.

[Something I struggle with is that many of the FOMO stocks actually end up being good stocks to own long-term, the problem is that most don't. Take TSLA or SQ as an example, these have always had a lot of hype behind them, but have also been great stocks to own over the years.  I have the same reverse FOMO feeling you're describing whenever I see a stock that's hyped here or seems very expensive, but I've learnt that feeling doesn't always serve me well. Back in 2014 I really wanted to invest in NFLX, but the price was so high and there was so much hype around Netflix back then that I figured it would probably come down and I could get in at a better valuation later. But I never got in later and I missed out on what would have been a 10x return. I felt similar about AMZN back when it was trading at a PE over 100 too. Seemed expensive and everyone was hyping about AWS at the time so I mistakenly stayed away.  These days I try to assume my gut instinct is wrong and that the FOMO is right. If I can make a valuation make sense based on the FOMO narrative then it's probably worth looking into more. Stocks like NET and CRWD which are both very expensive and very hyped fall into this category for me. While I can acknowledge I'm paying a premium to own both of them, they're also great companies which in theory should be able to grow into their valuation. I could try waiting for a better entry price, but like with NFLX and AMZN I suspect I won't find a perfect time so sometimes it's better to just follow the FOMO than miss out entirely.  If a stock has a mediocre product that's easy to disrupt, along with an excessive valuation and a lot of hype I find then it's generally a bad investment. Stocks like PTON and ZM fall into this category for me.](/r/stocks/comments/s2dfgs/anyone_else_suffer_from_reverse_fomo/hsdy42j/)

rzeq6r,"Today I (33M) told my gf (36F) I wouldn't mind if she had casual sex with other people. I had been thinking about this for a while and I feel that this is the most ethical way of living in a relationship assuming that you cannot possibly fulfill all of the other person's needs and desires and I don't feel any less of a man because of that. I cannot forbid her of satisfying any of her desires, especially the ones I cannot meet.

At first she rejected the idea. She has always said there is no sharing in a relationship. But I felt like this was the right thing to do so I opened up with her.

We have a 1 year old boy who she is still breastfeeding, so her initial reaction might have been a mix of her lower than normal libido and her preconceived notions of a relationship.

A few moments later she got curious and asked if she were to have sex outside our relationship whether I wanted to know about it or not. I said I did and we agreed that if she ever wanted to have fun outside our relationship she would tell me first.

I don't think she is going to make use of this new arrangement any time soon. I don't even know if she was serious when she agreed to it. However now I'm a bit insecure about it. One thing is to think I would be okay with it and another is to actually go through the experience, maybe I will feel like crap. I also got extremely anxious (like I was inviting my crush on a first date) and physically turned on when I started talking to her about it, so right now I'm really confused. Maybe I would even enjoy watching?

Also, I do not expect her to return the favor or anything like that, is it healthier for the relationship if I seek for equal rights (later, not now)? I do think that if she starts making use of her privileges but she is not okay with me doing the same it will probably feel unfair to me.

So we met at a bar last Friday for the first time. Physical attraction was there so that was good. We had a drink until we quickly decided to just skip the small talk and get right to our intentions, which was casual fun.  So we went back to his place and fooled around.

Afterwards, the night was still pretty young (around 10PM) so I decided to go out dancing with friends. I was ready to leave his place in the bathroom until I noticed some pretty serious hickeys on the left side of my neck (like they‚Äôre big bruising almost like that area got strangled)

Ok so I felt his kissing and sucking on my neck was pretty intense but I didn‚Äôt think it was THAT bad. Like it‚Äôs really bad, luckily I was wearing a turtle neck so it completely covered it when I was out and it seems like I‚Äôm going to have to be mindful and covering it up for the next week or two.

I‚Äôm disappointed and embarrassed at myself for letting this guy give me these insane hickeys (considering we just met for the first time) but also kind of upset at him, like does he not have self control?

s90yql,"I would put 3 things in here. The first is a quote, ironically, from a woman, who lived for a time as a man and wrote about her experiences. The main quote is:

*If you have never been sexually attracted to women, you will never quite understand the monumental power of female sexuality, except by proxy or in theory, nor will you quite know the immense advantage it gives us over men. Dating women as a man was a lesson in female power, and it made me, of all things, into a momentary misogynist, which I suppose was the best indicator that my experiment had worked. I saw my own sex from the other side, and I disliked women irrationally for a while because of it. I disliked their superiority, their accusatory smiles, their entitlement to choose or dash me with a fingertip, an execution so lazy, so effortless, it made the defeats and even the successes unbearably humiliating. Typical male power feels by comparison like a blunt instrument, its salvos and field strategies laughably remedial next to the damage a woman can do with a single cutting word: no.*

*Sex is most powerful in the mind, and to men, in the mind, women have a lot of power, not only to arouse, but to give worth, self-worth, meaning, initiation, sustenance, everything. Seeing this more clearly through my experience, I began to wonder whether the most extreme men resort to violence with women because they think that's all they have, their one pathetic advantage over all she seems to hold above them. I make no excuses for this. There are none. But as a man I felt vaguely attuned to this mind-set or its possibility. I did not inhabit it, but I thought I saw how rejection might get twisted beyond recognition in the mind of a discarded male where misogyny and ultimately rape may be a vicious attempt to take what cannot be taken because it has not been bestowed.*

there are also other gems from the same book, [here's a longer excerpt](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/mar/18/gender.bookextracts).

The second one would be an amazing blog post from a few years ago called [radicalizing the romanceless](http://web.archive.org/web/20140901012139/http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/08/31/radicalizing-the-romanceless/), which just about perfectly describes the situation men were facing in the world, and the reactions they were getting online, giving an alternate source for all that 'toxic masculinity' people who were complaining about, yet might have been helping to create at the same time.

The third I unfortunately can't locate. It's been posted here before, like [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/PurplePillDebate/comments/q40jpa/a_transgender_man_describes_what_it_was_like/) but that got deleted and I don't have a link to it elsewhere, perhaps someone else can help with that.

PS: I know mine are obviously male perspective, but I want to just mention that I am authentically hoping to see some really good links or quotes from the female perspective that shed new light for me - IOW this isn't a 'here's why I'm right and you're wrong' post, unless your perspective is that men only perpetrate hardship on women and never the other way around.","What are the quotes/texts that you think best encapsulate your experiences as the gender/sexual preference you are, dealing with the opposite sex and dating?",2.0,2.0

s85m87,"Inspired by the previous post about people's opinion about slagging in the workplace, I would like to collect more information about your guys slagging habits.

I'm a foreigner who has been in IE for quite a while now. Slagging is something which I've always observed and loved here, but from a distance. The last few years I have started getting more involved in it, but it has had variable results. While it has been extreme fun, sometimes I really overdid it, once I even seriously hurt my already mentally ill friends feelings. 

After that incident, I curbbed my verbal poking, not only do I not want to be a bad friend, that was extremely embarrassing as well.

I never thought Robert De Niro would play this negative character so well. I felt he was only cut out for good and gangster type of roles but MY LORD I was so wrong. He literally turned into this devil maniac who hunts and prey on the weaknesses of his victims which scared me as I watching it. He perfectly nailed the role of a Phycopath.

s41s38,"There is no National Labor shortage, only companies who refuse to treat their employees and prospects like human beings: A short story. 

On November 20th I applied to an Indeed job listing at United Healthcare. I submitted my application, my r√©sum√©, and a cover letter in an effort to put my best foot forward. On December 5th I was invited to complete both a video introduction interview as well as an Assessment. I completed both steps and sent a thank you email to the talent acquisition representative that was handling my application. I received a response from them noting that my assessment score was extremely high and they would be forwarding my information to the hiring managers for follow up regarding a final interview. Shortly after this I received an invitation to attend a virtual interview with a hiring manager on December 16th. On the day of the interview I prepared, practiced, and visited the company page to learn more about United, and the role Itself. The zoom interview was scheduled for 2pm, I logged on at 1:55 and patiently waited until 2:30pm, when a completely different person joined the call than I was expecting. The initial hiring manager never showed and instead I conducted the interview with (let‚Äôs call her heather). Heather and I spoke for nearly an hour and a half. I was confident, responsive, and engaged throughout the interview. We were both enjoying being able to share our experiences and I was enjoying learning more about the company. At the end of this interview I was told by Heather that I was an exceptional candidate for this position and she was excited to see where I ended up following training. She told me she would forward my information to the rest of the team leads at the Chico Location, and I would hear back regarding my onboarding process the following week. 

So I waited. 

The following week there was no correspondence at all. I assumed incorrectly that this was due to the holidays, and stood by. Christmas week passed by and still nothing so I called the talent acquisition service number I was provided and was informed they were still making final selections, but that I had made it into the top 50 out of 1267 applicants for the position. I was instructed to wait for a response and I should hear back within 24 hours. 

So I waited.

Another full week passed by and Monday January 5th I called again. I was told that I was a final selection for the training class starting on the 24th of January and that my onboarding instructions would be sent later that week. CELEBRATION üéä. Or so I thought. 

So I waited. 

A week goes by and now I‚Äôm concerned. I am now running out of time to complete my onboarding process, as well as to give my current employers ample notice. 
On Monday January 10th I called again, to explain I still had not received any instructions as to my drug testing and onboarding steps. 
I was then told by the talent team that I had been invited to interview on January 5th and never confirmed an interview. I explained that this must be a mistake, as I had already interviewed twice for this role, and had been verbally offered the position by Heather, the hiring manager. The individual I spoke with informed me that he could see that on his end and would correct the issue, and send off my offer letter personally. He asked me to wait 24 hours for this to be completed. 

So I waited. 

This Wednesday I woke up to a email thanking me for applying, and completing the interview process, and that the company was sorry that I had withdrawn my application. I immediately called again and explained my plight, and was told to wait 24 hours and that I would receive an update. 

So I waited.

Today, January 14th I called the talent acquisition team for the last time. Today, I was told by a representative that he would forward my information to the hiring department, but could not give me an update as to when I would hear back from them. I asked if I could speak directly to the hiring department, or a hiring manager, and was denied. I waited nearly a month following a verbal job offer to be told they could not give me any answer as to why my application was withdrawn, why my offer letter was not sent, nor any other update was sent my way. 

This is a grievous misuse of an applicants time and energy. Which is incredibly defeating coming from a company that prides itself on ‚ÄúDoing life‚Äôs best work.‚Äù You are a billion dollar company, and people are watching.",Offered a job and then was ghosted.,2.0,2.0

sbggzm,"I'm sitting here in tears having lost another regular customer over the stupid confusion and community discord around masks. 

We are just trying to do the right thing and follow government currently stands, and keep covid out of our stores to keep my staff as safe as we can.    

This rule isn't mine. We are required by government direction to ask people to check in and wear masks, and last I checked the rules haven't changed on this. 

* People are arguing that it is a ""mandate"" not a ""law"", as if somehow that makes the penalties any less for us if we don't follow the rules. The reality is that mandatory masks are covered by the Emergency Declarations passed through Parliament and so we are just trying to do what is required. 
* People are saying we are discriminating. I've been called a Nazi. I've also been acused of upholding apartheid. If these people really wanted to walk a mile in my transgender shoes they would understand what real discrimination was. If they properly understood history they would realise that what is happening here pales into insignificance to the horrors of Nazi Germany. If they properly understood apartheid they would realise that requiring people to wear masks is an insignificant ask compared to the atrocities that apartheid wrought on people of colour in South Africa. And if people actually took a millisecond to try and understand my heart they would realise that my empathic heart is driven by compassion, and my purpose in life is to teach people to live more sustainably. And it pains me to see such division and discord in our community at the moment.
* So I'm torn. I hate that covid is here, I hate that people are being asked to do things they don't want to do, and I hate that they are lashing out and punishing small family owned businesses like ours who have been doing it brutally tough since the start of the pandemic, and are already struggling in a world of pain with the current downturn caused by covid and exacerbated the opening of the borders. Yet, we must abide by the law and do what is being asked of us, correct? 
* These people are asking my to rebel against the law, to disregard the legal requirements and to not require people to wear masks when they enter our stores. They don't like what the government is telling them for whatever reason, and so they are requiring me to break the law or they will boycott us? 
* To be clear, this latest customer does not have a mask exemption. He just doesn't want to wear a mask and says (quoting 42 peer reviewed studies at the bottom of the essay of an angry email he sent me this afternoon) that the science shows that masks don't prevent the transmission of viruses. Maybe those studies do show that. I'm certainly not qualified to argue for or against that claim and I'll leave that to the medically qualified professionals to battle that one out. And maybe the government's position will change in time. But in the meantime we have to follow the rules or get penalised by the Government, right? And so if it is an issue that is completely and utterly out of our hands or ability to influence ..., why ... punish ... small ... businesses ... already ... doing ... it ... tough, instead of levelling this type of outrage at the Government? Why? probably because we are an easy target. Because they can get face to face with my staff when they can't get face to face with the Premier, Health Minister or Chief Medical officer. How do I even respond to this? 
* And this person hasn't been the only one. The first instance of this type of behaviour was a lady in our Blackwood shop who got verbally abusive after being asked politely if she had a mask. When she said she had a mask exemption she was politely asked to share that (after not checking in). She went off, standing over one of my team members, yelling abuse before storming out the shop and slamming the door. A friend who was in the store at the time was horrified at the woman's behaviour. She then proceeded to spew her hate in a private Facebook group, where people told her to name and shame, and we were blacklisted by thousands of people. She made up a story of how my staff were rude to her, abused her, and made her feel bad. CCTV footage and eyewitness accounts would prove that claim to be a downright lie. But the story made for a juicy post in a certain private Facebook group, and so the troops in that group rallied, leaving negative reviews about our business and boycotted our shop. I have a friend who was a member of that group and when he questioned the validity of her story (after fact checking with me) he was booted out.
* There have been many more examples like this, and I hate that my team are on the receiving end of this kind of behaviour. And it isn't just us. Pretty much everyone I've spoken to has stories like this to share, store managers and owners alike.  
* To make matters worse, because covid is here and people have been told to stay home, business is super slow, and we've reduced trading hours and cut rosters just to try and keep the wheels turning. It is tough enough at the moment without losing existing customers because of confusing messaging over masks and check-ins, and delayed announcements over changes to requirements.
* I'm told by someone who has a friend in the contact tracing team that no contract tracing is being done for check-ins at retail/hospitality businesses. So why are we still required to ensure people are checking in? If it no longer serves a purpose, why not drop that requirement and allow us to all take a collective breath of relief?
* So here I am, stuck between a rock and a f\*cking hard place. Some people are pissy at us for following the rules as they stand, and others are telling us that they feel safer in our stores because we do. Our policy on masks (following the government rules) is causing us to lose one group of customers when we desperately need every sale at the moment. Yet if I relax that policy (and don't abide by the rules) then I lose another group of customers

I can't f\*cking win at the moment

If nothing else, if you don't have a medical exemption, please, please wear a mask even if just to show the retail assistants and service staff that you respect them and their workplaces enough to endure a little inconvenience for their sake. Don't take it out on them, and don't take it out on the business owners who I'm sure are all just trying to make a living in the most difficult of times. 

I've had people say to me that these people are ""idiots"", and that these ""anti-vaxxers/maskers"" are misled by misinformation, and I should just ignore them. But clearly, if someone can articulate an argument and present 42 peer reviewed studies to support their case (like this guy did), they aren't an idiot. And how do I ignore a customer sharing their opinions and vowing never to shop with us again? I don't disagree with some of the logic presented but again, the law requires us to act a certain way so that's what we have to do or we get penalised. These are people too, and they are angry, frustrated, scared and tired. 

As I said in the subject, I am f\*cking over this. Over covid. Over the stress. Over the division. Over the financial struggle. Over the fear. Over the lack of strong leadership, and lack of clear direction at the moment. Over the misinformation. Over the confusion. 

And so totally over people taking aim at us and at me simple because I'm trying to follow the law. 

Our team have worked their collective asses off over the past three years to try and spread awareness that Australia's longest running eco-stores are here in Adelaide, and they are amazing places to visit. And we've spent hundreds of thousands of dollars trying to get the word out to encourage locals to support our SA owned and operated small business, instead of the big corporate-owned interstate websites.

And just when we felt like we were starting to gain some traction, hate-filled facebook posts by people who are angry with the world right now result in undoing months, maybe even years of effort resulting in hundreds (if not thousands) of people boycott us.

That hurts. Deeply.

Tbh my playstyle isnt reliant on 4* skills, but I just went from usually getting 8/20 to 7/10 with daka only scoring less then 2 goals in 2 games. Half my opponents quit before halftime and daka still managed 21 goals and 3 assists in 10. The 85x10 is great as well obviously. So if you are going for that its a very good option too. Personally i prefer daka, but thats just my opinion.

Why exactly is he that good in my eyes. 3 reasons..

1. Shooting 4* wf
He finishes everything. Havent tried a lot of longshots. But in the box he scores on his right and left, near post as well as far post. With 94 finishing you just put it in the back of the net every time. 

2. Agilty and pace
Insane combo using ballrolls roulettes, right stick dribbling and a lot of running you can pretty much get past every defender on this game.

3.Physicality
Hes not insanely physical player. But the combination of 6,0 and 78 is strength is just enough to shield and keep the ball in a lot of situations where most players wouldnt.

Also passing is NOT a problem on this card. With 81 short passing he does not really play bad passes. Its not amazing, but i wouldnt even call it bad. Its just as good as you need it to be on a striker.",Do Daka (daka review),2.0,2.0

Rewatching the first 5 seasons of RHOBH this week whilst I was sick got me thinking about why the franchise is probably one of the least successful imo and has gone down hill.

The introduction of Erika was a huge mistake, personally I don‚Äôt like her attitude, but I think the reason why it was such a misstep is because the show suddenly became a fashion show. Everyone needed the best hill and to constantly be in makeup and gowns, we lost the sense of realness that was there before.

Forgot and Teddy added absolutely nothing, and now we have two actresses (Kyle and Lisa R) who are fighting for screen time and attention with shocked faces and faux emotions.

If I had the choice of juggling the cast I would honestly say:

Demote crystal to friend of (allowing her to have another season to blossom but I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs earned her diamond)

Fire Erika and Dorit

Then we can bring back Kim, Lisa V and Brandi, who will hopefully humble rinna and Kyle.

s60w8u,"I find myself in a bit of an unusual situation. My upstairs neighbour is going to be leaving in a couple of months, and her landlord is putting the flat up for sale. I might be in a position to buy it before it goes on the open market and let it out.

The thing that's causing me some hesitation, though, is that I've never liked the idea of private rented accommodation. We had a shitty time in the past when we were renting, although that was down to the letting agents rather than the landlords. Taking ages to organise repairs, conducting unannounced ""inspections"" when we weren't in and helping themselves to my whisky and watering it down thinking I wouldn't notice, lying about the condition of the flat when we moved out and holding on to our deposit, and then threatening me with legal action when I posted about what they'd done online.

Basically, I'm worried that there's something about becoming a landlord that turns people into Tory pricks. I'm aware that if I don't buy the place, someone else will, and it's much more likely to be a buy-to-let type in my area than an owner-occupier. Is it possible to be a landlord without being exploitative, or is it just a necessary part of the business if you don't want to lose all your money?

Honestly, the main attraction of buying the flat would be that we'd have some control over who our neighbours are. We've had loads of trouble with noise and antisocial behaviour, and we'd like to ensure we don't get someone similar or worse in the future.",Is it possible to be a landlord without being a total bawbag?,2.0,2.0

What she did was in spite of people who did wrong to her but I don't think she understood the constant guilt and regret some of the people on the tape must have felt after everything. They could have constant trauma from what they have done and get stuck in the past. I know some of you will disagree and say that she has trauma and just wanted to get revenge but what she did was not morally right. People on the tapes weren't morally right either (Fuck you Bryce) but the whole idea of her recordings was to tell them what they did wrong and why they were a reason she killed herself.

ru2ekd,"The pandemic situation obviously hasn't helped, but there seems to be shitloads of aggression and attitude on the streets.

Everyway you turn there's a roaming pack of mullet sporting braindead bogan cavemen who've spent more time in tattoo chairs than a classroom death staring and/or taunting anyone they cross paths with, bonehead tradies with E plates driving their utes like fucking maniacs on the roads, worshipping Neanderthal Footy and Rugby players... women seem to be getting more feral too.

The last couple of times I've gone out to clubs/pubs I've seen belligerent dickheads fighting, people getting thrown out left right and centre, stupid machismo drama, I'll get deliberately elbowed, I'll cop hostile stares, it's bullshit nobody should have to put up with. There are some nice bars and spots around Perth these days but the experience is marred by all the aggressive losers.

A few weeks ago I was walking to the escape rooms in Northbridge when a drug fucked guy with a pole and concrete (As though he had ripped a bollard out of the ground) started lurching toward me...that was more intense than the escape room. He didn't look homeless either, just like a big meathead ape turned methhead who needed to be sent back to his cave.

Northbridge is obviously an epicentre of big dickhead energy, But it abounds in shopping malls and suburban streets as well; a while back I was walking around Lakeside Joondalup with 2 female friends and I basically had to act as their bodyguard; they were blatantly catcalled by a groups of dickheads as we left the train station; then I was walking to get lunch at another section when they called me and asked me to come back quick - there was literally a group of about 8 eshay rats just stalking them making their usual animal noises with the words 'slut' and 'bitch' intelligible every now and then, we had to make a b-line for an exit and get the fuck out of there. Honestly the thought crossed my mind 'if you lined up these worthless scumbags in front of a firing squad the world would become a slightly better place'. I know it's harsh but...true?

On a few occasions I've seen pricks turning up to shops without masks and causing a scene when they're not allowed in.  Unfortunately these incidents are more memorable than all the thousands of people I've seen doing the right thing.

I even know preppy guys from western suburbs private schools who's parents are doctors etc who try incredibly hard to act masculine/blokey, putting on an exaggerated Aussie accent, the obligatory tattoos arm/calf tattoos, mullet cut, walking around with an attitude.

I recently went to help out at my younger cousins school for a day and half the guys look like what would have been considered derro when I was at school - obviously this is the style at the moment, but it seemed like a lot of them were acting up to the image and behaving like little scumbags.

On NYE I was at a small gathering when a fight broke out between guys who used to be friends (over covid vaccinations lol) and everyone was being generally a lot more opinionated and less tactful than usual.

It feels like just disagreeing with someone these days is a prelude to getting screamed at or dodging a fist. The fuck is wrong with people?

I thought global culture was slowly moving more toward acceptance and empathy, so why does it seem like there's more aggression and bigotry than ever?

Maybe it's always been like this and I've just been focusing on the negatives lately.

Maybe it's just as bad everywhere in the world.

Maybe I'm just expecting too much decency from other people

s8kfe1,"When we talk about accolades for NBA players, there are always a few key items on the checklist: All-Star trips, All-NBA berths, MVPs, etc. But one rules them all: *rings.* 

The mad quest for [gold](https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/Smaug) has led players on journeys all across the map. Are they trying to win out of a competitive spirit? To shut up critics and trolls? To earn glory that will last a lifetime? Obviously that has worked from time to time, but other times the effort feels a little empty -- even in success. Perhaps your team was TOO good (like Kevin Durant), or you weren't the MAIN star on the team, or your opponent got injured. 

It's also fair to say that winning a ring isn't all that unusual. If my math checks out, a team wins a title every year. That makes 75 years of NBA champions -- 65 years of MVP (which started in 1956) -- 53 years of Finals MVP (which started in 1969). It's an exclusive club -- especially when you consider repeats -- but it's a growing one.

In contrast, there's a prestigious club that will grow more slowly. A basketball honor that we don't discuss very often. That is: being the **greatest player in your franchise's history.** 

Perhaps the fact that we don't discuss that topic very often devalues the concept and contributes to a culture of team swapping and ring chasing. If we valued the Team GOAT as a badge of honor, perhaps players would stick around more often and build their legacy at home. 

Of course, there's no easy way to define a Team GOAT. There's subjectivity involved in terms of what criteria you use and what accolades you value the most. Then again, when has subjectivity ever stopped us from debating player rankings before?

Interested in that topic, I wanted to go through the league and review each team's GOAT, and debate whether a current player has a chance of grabbing that mantle. An important note of distinction here: we're not talking about the best player to ever weigh a team's uniform -- we're rankings these players contributions on THAT team and that team only, as if their other years didn't exist.

Rather than give specific percentage odds for each, we'll group them into a few tiers. Locks or **Near Locks** (defined as over an 80% chance), **Likely** (somewhere in between 50-80% chance), **Possible** (somewhere in between 25-50%), **Unlikely** (5-25%), and **Almost No Chance** (less than 5%).

---

######**TEAM GOAT DISCUSSIONS**

**ATLANTA.** For this exercise, we're going to lean heavily on total ""win shares"" with the team, which is conveniently listed on basketball-reference's team pages. Using that as our default ranking, two candidates emerge: Bob Pettit (136 win shares, mostly when the team was in St. Louis) and Dominque Wilkins (107 WS). Pettit may be harder to beat than young fans realize; he was an All-Star in each of his 11 seasons, and he won MVP twice. In fact, he cracked the top 5 in MVP voting on 8 separate occasions. Even more notably, he led the team to their only NBA championship. That's an incredible resume that's going to be tough for Trae Young to beat. Young can best Pettit in longevity and total points, but he's probably going to need to win multiple titles to get this more nuanced honor. We'll call this one **unlikely.** If the Hawks can reconfigure their roster and get back to contender status, then perhaps this ups back into ""possible.""

---

**BOSTON**. Like Trae Young, Jayson Tatum benefits from a ""one-and-done"" era where he can jump to the NBA and start putting up numbers immediately. He's in his 5th season right now and he's still only 23 years old. Averaging about 6.5-7 wins shares per year, he can potentially crack 100. That said, this isn't a franchise that's graded by win shares. They win *titles.* Whether you want to call their GOAT Bill Russell (164 WS, 11 titles, 5 MVPs) or Larry Bird (146 WS, 3 titles, 3 MVPs), there's **almost no chance** that Tatum rises to the top of this ladder.

---

**BROOKLYN**. Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving surprised a lot of people when they chose to go to the Nets, a team without much of a storied history. Perhaps they were anticipating this post. After all, there's a wide open lane here. ""Dr. J"" Julius Erving led the Nets to two ABA titles, and Jason Kidd led the team to two NBA Finals, but neither stayed with the franchise long. Erving lasted 3 seasons, Kidd only 6.5. As a result, the team's leader in win shares is Buck Williams with 63. Going forward, the question will be: how long can Kevin Durant (age 33) last? How many titles can he rack up in the meantime? The longevity won't be on his side, but winning a couple of titles may be a realistic goal presuming this team can be healthy at the right time. Despite all the injury issues, they're still the Vegas favorite this season. Given that, Durant or James Harden may be **possible** Team GOATS. Then again, it's ""possible"" the team isn't healthy down the stretch and blows it up entirely this summer.

---

**CHARLOTTE**. Even if we include the old Charlotte Hornets' history here, this is another franchise with a relatively open lane to GOAT. In over 30+ years, they've never even reached the Conference Finals. Kemba Walker leads the way with 48.5 win shares, which is an attainable goal for young LaMelo Ball. Ball snagged 2.8 as a rookie, and is on pace to double that this season. If he can play 10 years with the franchise, he'll likely become their GOAT. Will he actually stay in Charlotte that long? It's TBD, so let's call this one **possible** as well.

---

**CHICAGO**. Super scorer Zach LaVine has proven a lot of skeptics wrong, but he'd need to clone himself a few times to come close to Michael Jordan (205 WS, 6 titles, 5 MVPS). Our scale only goes as low as almost **no chance**, and this certainly qualifies.

---

**CLEVELAND.** The Cavs are in a similar boat here. Young studs Darius Garland and Evan Mobley both have awesome futures, but there‚Äôs a difference between awesome and immortal. **Almost no chance** they can surpass the iconic achievements of LeBron James here.

---

**DALLAS**. LaMelo Ball is chasing Kemba Walker in Charlotte, but Luka Doncic has a much higher bar here in Dirk Nowitzki. Thanks in part to his incredible longevity and loyalty, Nowitzki racked up 206 win shares with the team in addition to an MVP and NBA title. The win shares will be tough. Luka's career high is 8.8, so even if he gets to 10 a year, he'll need to rattle off 15+ years of peak performance. Going for multiple MVPs or multiple championships may be the easier path here. Can Luka win more than 1 of each? I wouldn't say that it's likely, but it's definitely **possible.** Dallas doesn't look like a title contender yet, but there's plenty of time for the kid (still age 22.)

---

**DENVER**. The international takeover continues. At the moment, the franchise leaders in win shares are Dan Issel (95) and Alex English (84). However, there's a Serbian freight train behind them that's about to run them off the road. Jokic has racked up an incredible 71 win shares in his career despite being only 26. He had 15.5 last season alone. Even if you think advanced stats are too kind to the Joker, he can make up for it with his MVP trophy, which neither Issel nor English have. As long as Jokic plays a few more seasons, he's a **near lock** to grab the GOAT status here.

---

**DETROIT.** After a slow start, # 1 pick Cade Cunningham is heating up and looking the part of a future All-Star. He also takes pride in his leadership abilities and may be the type of player to stick around for 10+ years. In terms of *win shares*, that may put him in play over franchise leader Bill Laimbeer (98 WS). In terms of *legacy*, he still will be **unlikely** to pass Isiah Thomas, who racked up 2 titles and 11 All-Star appearances. That's nothing against Cunningham -- it's just friggin' hard to win multiple championships.

---

**GOLDEN STATE.** It's hard to win multiple championships -- it's hard to be a Team GOAT. But at the moment, we have one player who has already done it. Steph Curry has recently passed over Wilt Chamberlain in total win shares for the team -- 117 to 114 (Chamberlain didn't play his entire career with them). Add in the fact that Curry won 2 MVPs and 3 titles and his overall impact on the game, and he could retire tomorrow as the greatest Warrior of all time. He's our first official **lock.**

---

**HOUSTON**. Perhaps Damian Lillard should take note, because James Harden essentially waved the white flag on his quest for Team GOAT with his trade demand last year. If he had stuck around, perhaps Harden (115 WS) could have challenged Hakeem Olajuwon (160) for the top spot. That said, matching Olajuwon and winning two titles would have been much more difficult. Looking forward, is there any chance Jalen Green or Alperen Sengun could threaten Olajuwon? *Theoretically*, sure, but realistically let's call this **almost no chance.**

---

**INDIANA**. Although he never got over the hump, Reggie Miller (174 WS) has a comfortable stranglehold on his team's GOAT. It's looking less and less likely -- **almost no chance** -- that a current team star like Domatas Sabonis could challenge him. Sabonis has made 2 All-Stars in his 5 years with the team, but his 30 win shares are a loooong way away from Miller. And according to some rumors, Sabonis may not be here much longer.

---

**L.A. CLIPPERS**. We have an opening, table 12. The Clippers have existed for over 50 seasons in some form or another, but they never won a title. Their best player ever is probably Chris Paul (team high 78 WS), but he only played 6 seasons with the franchise. Current stars Kawhi Leonard and Paul George may have trouble matching that, but they have a decent shot to win a title if they both come back healthy next year. To Clippers fans, I'd presume that's more meaningful than CP3's good-but-not-great ""Lob City"" era. Let's call it **possible.**

---

**L.A. LAKERS**. LeBron James already won a title in L.A. and could potentially win more, but he has **almost no chance** to beat local legends like Kobe Bryant (team high 173 WS, 5 titles, 1 MVP) or Magic Johnson (156 WS, 5 titles, 3 MVPs.) Remember, we're only talking about their contributions on this particular team.

---

**MEMPHIS**. The Grizzlies don't have the type of history as the Lakers do, which puts this franchise in play. The best right now would probably be Marc Gasol (77 WS). But while Gasol had one DPOY, the rest of his resume is a little light for a Team GOAT -- he only made 3 All-Star teams and never finished higher than 8th in MVP voting. Given that, Ja Morant's ascension is certainly **possible.** Heck, he's on target to finish in the top 8 in MVP this season. If he stays healthy and sticks around Memphis for his whole career, he'll likely best Gasol in WS. Of course, the real key may be whether his squad can make a Finals appearance (the Grit n' Grind teams peaked in the Conference Finals.) 

---

**MIAMI**. Prime LeBron James was the best player in franchise history, but in terms of career accomplishments it'd have to be Dwyane Wade (116 WS, 3 titles.) Jimmy Butler arrived too late to challenge that, and Bam Adebayo doesn't have the type of game that's going to put him in MVP races. I'd suggest there's **almost no chance** either can challenge Wade here.

---

**MILWAUKEE**. So far, we've given one Team GOAT to Steph Curry, and presumed Nikola Jokic is on the verge of cracking that in Denver. The same applies here to Giannis Antetokounmpo, whom I'll call another **near lock.** I don't think he officially has it yet though. Although Kareem Abdul-Jabbar only played 6 years for the franchise, he holds a lead over Giannis in win shares 115 to 81. Giannis should be able to pass him in a couple of years though and end all debates about Team GOAT status (again, career value, not prime value.)

---

**MINNESOTA**. The Timberwolves have never won a title or even made the Finals in their 33-year history, but Kevin Garnett still feels like he's locked into the top spot as a beloved Team GOAT. He racked up 140 win shares, 10 All-Star trips, and 1 MVP by the time he left for Boston. In theory, Karl-Anthony Towns may be able to challenge the win shares if he sticks around (he's about halfway there at 61 right now), but I don't know if he has enough of a two-way game to supplant Garnett in the minds of fans. A title would do it, but that's more **unlikely** than realistic. 

---

**NEW ORLEANS**. If we count all versions dating back to 2002, then Chris Paul is going to grab his second Team GOAT here (as he leads the team with 76 win shares and came closest to winning MVP.) It's a beatable total, but can it be beaten by Zion Williamson or Brandon Ingram? If fully healthy, Williamson would have a great chance. He recorded 8.7 win shares in just 61 games last season. But can we expect Williamson to play 6-7 years at an elite level? And stay with this franchise for that whole time? That combo may be **unlikely** right now. Meanwhile, Ingram only has about 13 win shares in his 3 seasons, so I'm not sure he has enough upside to crack the top spot either.

---

**N.Y. KNICKS**. Right now, I'd give the nod to Patrick Ewing (team high 123 WS) despite the fact that he never won the title. Of the current crop, you'd presume a young player like R.J. Barrett may have the best chance if he improves and plays 10+ years with the team. Still, does he have it in him to beat Ewing and his 11 All-Star trips? It's between an ""unlikely"" and an **almost no chance** to me, so I'll lean to the latter.

---

**OKLAHOMA CITY**. If you include the Sonics history, then Gary Payton (124 WS) holds the lead over Kevin Durant (108 WS) and Russell Westbrook (97 WS). It's possible that young Shai Gilgeous-Alexander beats them in terms of longevity with the team, but there's **almost no chance** he can match their peak production and start winning MVPS. Keep grabbing those lottery balls, Sam Presti, because you may need another all-timer to get back to the Finals.

---

**ORLANDO**. Shaquille O'Neal only played 4 seasons with Orlando, so he trails Dwight Howard by a large margin in terms of win shares (88 to 48, respectively.) Younger fans may forget just how good Dwight Howard was in his day -- he cracked the top 5 in MVP voting in four separate seasons. I don't see any of the young Magic threatening that, so we'll give this one an **almost no chance** as well. 

---

**PHILADELPHIA**. Julius Erving is probably the most iconic 76er of all time, but if we base it on resume alone it may be hard to argue against Dolph Schayes. Back when the team was the Syracuse Nationals, Schayes led them to an NBA title and made 11 All-Star teams in the process. He also leads Erving in total win shares, 142 to 106. Current star Joel Embiid has a long way to go to reach that company. Given his durability problems, he's only reached 36 win shares -- a total that doesn't even crack the team's top 12 yet. He can probably make an argument if he wins multiple MVPs or multiple titles, but that's an **unlikely** combination. Of course, if Daryl Morey can pull in a haul for Ben Simmons at the deadline then we may have to rethink that. 

---

**PHOENIX**. Technically the team's leader in win shares is Shawn Marion with 93, but I'd say that either Steve Nash (83 WS) or Charles Barkley (44 WS) would be Team GOAT based on peak performance. I don't think there's much chance that Devin Booker is going to challenge for MVPs in the same way -- he's already in his 7th season and he's never cracked an All-NBA team yet. His advanced stats have never been great either, so he's only gotten up to 25.3 win shares so far. Still, it's **possible** that he can work his way into Team GOAT discussions in another way. The Suns haven't won a title in their 54-year history. If Booker can help make that happen -- and have a long, Reggie Miller-ish career -- then I think he'd be considered the franchise's GOAT.

---

**PORTLAND**. The inspiration for this post, Damian Lillard may have to sacrifice his chances to be Team GOAT if he never plays for the Trail Blazers again. In terms of *peak* performance, the best Blazer of all time is Bill Walton (who won the title and then MVP), but Walton only played 4 years for the franchise. In terms of career performance, Lillard is chasing Clyde Drexler. Drexler racked up 109 win shares (to Lillard's 95), 8 All-Star appearances (to Lillard's 6), and 2 Finals appearance (to Lillard's 0.) Where Lillard can make up for that deficit is longevity. Drexler left the team at age 32, while Lillard is still there (for now) at age 31. If he stays loyal and sticks around for 3-4 more years, he's **likely** to be considered their best ever.

---

**SACRAMENTO**. The ""Sacramento Kings"" don't have an illustrious history, but this franchise has been around the mill (first as the Rochester Royals, then Cincinnati Royals, then Kansas City Kings, then Sacramento Kings.) If we include all that history, there's **almost no chance** that De'Aaron Fox can surpass the individual greatness of Oscar Robertson (154 win shares.)

---

**SAN ANTONIO**. Ditto here. There are 5 San Antonio Spurs with 100+ win shares, led by Tim Duncan (206 WS) and David Robinson (179 WS.) When you factor in the titles to boot, then there's **almost no chance** that any of these young Spurs can reach those heights.

---

**TORONTO**. Kawhi Leonard was the face of the championship, but I suspect most Toronto fans would consider Kyle Lowry (75 win shares) their greatest player in whole. Lowry ""only"" played 9 years for the team, so it's possible that a young stud like Scottie Barnes can surpass that and surpass the win share total. Can he match Lowry's 6 All-Star trips and NBA title? That's somewhere between possible and **unlikely.** Barnes' all-around game doesn't lend itself to gaudy numbers and All-Star votes, but it's too hard to count out a rookie who's been this good.

---

**UTAH**. The Utah Jazz are good enough to contend for a title either this year or next. But even with that, I don't think anyone would consider Donovan Mitchell or Rudy Gobert on par with the freakish durability and longevity of Karl Malone (230 win shares) or John Stockton (208 WS). It'd probably take 2-3 titles for Gobert (third in franchise history with 82 WS) to take the mantle, and that falls into the **almost no chance** category.

---

**WASHINGTON**. Current star Bradley Beal has officially surpassed his old buddy John Wall on the win shares list (49 to 44), but he's still got some ways to go before he matches all-time leader Wes Unseld (110 WS.) Unseld also won an MVP and NBA trophy. The Beal Fan Club is formally petitioning for us to switch to ""total points"" though, because he's likely to catch franchise leader Elvin Hayes if he sticks around for next year (Hayes has 15,551, Beal 14,119.) Overall, it's hard to see the seeds of a title contending team here so we'll call this **unlikely.**

say0wg,"I F(51) and D(19) 'Joan' recently got into a heated argument and we are turning to random strangers on the internet for guidance in determining who is right. (I say 'we', as this post is her suggestion)

My kids were raised in a traditional, but non-religious, family. Husband and I have been married over 25 years. Although it was even admittedly rare back in the 90's, we actually waited until we were officially married before we had sex for the first time.

Currently, Joan is attending college and lives with us in our developed basement with a separate entrance. Our two other kids have moved out for good. Although Joan is not in a relationship, she is socially active and dates on occasion.

The issue - Last night, Joan was out with friends, and as mothers are prone to do, I never fall completely asleep until I hear her come home. So, last night, she was back around 1:00 AM and as I was still fully awake, I went downstairs to see how her night went.

I was, however, wholly unimpressed when I saw her on the couch with a guy she had just met that night. They weren't engaged in anything (yet) however, it was evident where events were likely to lead.

Although I was polite, I commented to Joan that she really needed to get to sleep as we were planning an early morning walk, and I waited patiently as her 'new friend' got the hint and left.

Afterwards, Joan was livid, and says that I thoroughly embarrassed her, and that, as she was an adult, she should be able to see whomever she wants, whenever she wants, and wherever she wants.

My position is that she is an adult, however, she has no right to bring a stranger into our house without my knowledge as:

1. It's a pandemic. We're all fully vaxxed. However, we have no idea of his health status. (She says that argument is a red-herring BECAUSE we are fully vaxxed and otherwise healthy)
2. Our house belongs to her dad and I. I'm not comfortable with having a complete stranger spend the night. (Her argument is that she's still a dependent as she's going to college and it's still her house too)
3. Although I don't approve, I agree that as an adult, she can engage in whatever legal activity she chooses. However, Not in my house. She knows my views on pre-marital sex, and by engaging in the activity in my house, with me at home, is a massive sign of disrespect.
4. If she really wants to spend the night with a random stranger, that's what hotels are for. (Her argument is that, although she's working, she's saving for her future, and that would be a stupid waste of money)

So, AITA for making her friend leave, or should I just ignore my long-held belief system and accept her choices as an adult?

EDIT - My husband's position is that he's taking the Switzerland position. Officially neutral. I'm not happy with his lack of support, but I'm not going to engage in a two front war at the moment.

EDIT - To answer a few questions and add some comments:

1. Joan does not pay rent. As with all our kids, she's on the 'Free room and board plan' so long as she is attending school.
2. I recognize that I hold a minority position in society. However, there was nothing more glorious than sharing a special intimacy with the man I loved on my wedding night, knowing that it was a special gift that we each bestowed on the other, never having shared with another. I believe it has made our marriage stronger over the years. It is a special bond that we alone share with each other.  I attempted to impart that feeling and knowledge onto all my kids in the hopes that they would be able to have the same unique experience, however, I am also realistic enough to know that, in this day and age, with Tinder and the like, it would be a miracle if any of them abstained prior to marriage.
3. I have never been a 'helicopter parent' and the notion that not resting comfortably until my daughter gets home on a Saturday night is akin to 'overparenting' is absurd. My husband is a retired Detective, and, as he always said to the kids, 'rarely does anything good happen at 3 in the morning'.
4. No, we had never discussed 'male sleep-overs' prior to last night, as the issue never came up. Would my feelings be different if Joan was in a long-term committed relationship? Honestly, I don't know. I'll have to cross that bridge when it happens.

FINAL EDIT - Thank you anonymous internet friends! Although my position 'won' with a NTA ruling, both my daughter and I gained some insight by reading through many of the comments.

Now that emotions have cooled off, Joan even made a comment that had both of us tear up with laughter....along the lines of my 'intervention' would be an instant entry into the 'C@ck-Block Hall of Fame'. I had never heard that term before.......kids these day! (And yes, even though many of you claimed that I am some puritan 50's Handmaid Tale wannabe, that's not the case at all. Our family has a solid sense of humor, and very little is off-limits).

Joan acknowledges that bringing someone she just met back to our house was inappropriate for a few reasons. In turn, I've left the door \*slightly\* open to the concept of a visit by a long term partner that we knew and were comfortable with - however - it would need to be discussed and agreed in advance.",AITA for not allowing my college-aged daughter 'sleep-overs' at our house w/opposite sex,2.0,2.0

rupz9h,"Soooo this is pretty new to me, but i've been lurking on this sub for quite a while and decided to make an account and confess my slutty sins! ‚ô°

My name is Gabriela but everybody calls me Gabi! I was born and raised in Puerto Rico even tho we moved to the states when I was in fourth grade. I'm 23, kinda small at a whooping 5' 4"" so I can't reach any high kitchen cabinets :( Without revealing too much I'll say God didn't grace me with being as thicc curvy goddess as other latinas and made me a petite bitch, but I have a small waist, big hips and I loove my tits, they're bigger than a handful and round and perky (I have a 32D bra size but bra sizes are nonsense can we all agree on stop using them to see how big tits are). I have a bit of a round face, thick dark hair and eyebrows and I dress kinda egirl, but way more cute than goth because I'm an weeb who walks around in anime merch. 

Thing is, I feel like guys have always seen me with sexual eyes. I developed earlier than other girls in high school and I guess the whole latina thing feels exotic to boys my age, some will do way too much to get me to call them 'papi'. Thing is, at first I was annoyed by it, but over time I've... kinda become addicted to it. I wouldn't say addicted, but sometimes it's totally the highlight of my day. I just love the attention, the feeling that they crave me, the power my own sensuality gives me. And I don't mean it in a dominant way, I'm the biggest submissive person in the world! I feel like I can't imagine sex without at least being a bit roughed up and dominated.

Admittedly I started kinda slow because I've always been taught to care about my reputation and not be easy around boys and all, but once I started and discovered how good it feels... Well, let's just say I'm kinda the Handjob Queen to my close male friends. I just love everything about sex, random hookups on clubs, men catcalling me on the street (just because I love it doesn't mean it's okay tho!). I love random men online being sexually aggressive to me when I go on public chats, I love confident men who know how to make a girl obey because I've been told I can be kinda bratty. It bothered me at first when people would fetishize me being puertorican, but it's something I've learned to incorporate about my identity sexually, if that makes sense? Something about a guy telling me he'll breed my latina pussy makes me melt >///<

I can't decide if I get hornier with praise or degradation, honestly.... I absolutely love degradation at first and it's what gets me faster into subspace, I always fall for bad guys üíî but praise is definitely what gets me needier and more submissive and compliant. I feel like the best sexual partner is the one that knows how to combine both, even if sometimes I get a little intense. I find a lot of doms to be softer than what I'd like with name-calling specially. They do it to be sexy but I want them to be **truly mean**. Like, if someone calls me a cunt as an insult I get instinctively wet, I'm pavlovian conditioned üò≠ But overall I just love being men's center of their sexual attention. This had led me to things I'm kinda not proud of too. Believe me, sex with married men is great and all but it can get pretty messy. 

Soooo I kinda guess this need and desire for attention is what brings me to post me here! I wanna share some of my sexual stories with likeminded lewd people in the future and meet fellow degenerates! What feels good about this subreddit is how non-judgemental everyone seems so I can let my inner slut out without worry, so I'm kinda excited about that. Tambien hablo espa√±ol si hay otros latinos aqu√≠ pero me siento mas comoda en ingles!! ·É¶

s9x42f,"In the past few years I‚Äôve decided that I most likely won‚Äôt have children. There are multiple reasons for this (I‚Äôm already in my late 20s, I have PCOS, I‚Äôm a professional nanny and have already helped raise a few children so I don‚Äôt know if I want to raise any of my own, etc.) but the main reason is because I want to have all of my time and energy devoted to serving my future Dominant.

I want to be able to spend hours cockwarming under His desk on the days He works from home. I want to be naked by the door waiting for Him when He comes home from work. I want to be able to get on my knees and swallow His piss at any time He needs it, to service Him and His friends whenever They come over to watch football, to not have to keep quiet while being mercilessly fucked at night or while I‚Äôm getting whipped/paddled/caned/spanked, to walk around proudly wearing His cum all over my face and His loving marks and bruises scattered across my skin, to be beneath Him eating His ass while he enjoys His morning coffee‚Ä¶.

Having children to raise would significantly impact the amount of time I‚Äôm able to do those things and I wouldn‚Äôt want to expose little ones to those things too young. Also, kids are expensive. Instead, money could be spent on things that would please my Man, like a home sex dungeon and multiple plastic surgeries to shape me into His ideal slut. My future Husband deserves the submissive housewife and slave of His dreams along with 24/7 service from her.

I‚Äôve thought about this all very rationally‚Ä¶. But my body doesn‚Äôt care about rational thinking, it only knows natural instinct. My body knows my biological purpose. Suddenly talking about breeding makes me so horny, I have to suppress the urge to moan out loud to certain text and chat messages I receive. The thought of a Man holding me down under His weight, slamming His cock deep inside me to the hilt, and emptying His balls inside of me makes me dripping wet. What is a single orgasm ‚Äî a pleasurable release, quickly over with and forgotten ‚Äî for Him, becomes nine hard months of growing and carrying another human being, ending with a very painful birth for me. Even this shows the place of a woman in this world vs. the place of a Man. My body knows that this is my purpose as a woman and I have a burning need to fulfill it. 

I have always regarded a Man‚Äôs seed as the most precious gift there is. Cum is the most important substance in the world. I absolutely treasure it as a true cumslut should. I would never dream of wasting a drop, I always gratefully swallow what is given to me. But I know there is an even greater purpose for his cum ‚Äî to breed me. Men have a strong impulse to cum deep inside a woman‚Äôs pussy. It feels the best for Them for a reason: because that‚Äôs where Their seed belongs! I want to feel the gush of His warm load fill me up and do everything in my power to hold it inside me. I‚Äôll lay with my legs up against a wall and pillows under my lower back, helping His sperm take hold. I want a Man to do this to me over and over, everyday until I‚Äôm successfully bred. (And then keep doing it once I‚Äôm knocked up, please!)

There‚Äôs a flood of warm, loving feelings that rush over me when I imagine my belly growing with my Man‚Äôs child inside me. What a beautiful thing that would be. I can‚Äôt imagine anything that would make me feel more owned than being bred by a Man. Impregnating a woman is the biggest mark of ownership a Man could make, it shows the whole world who she belongs to. To be chosen to carry and birth His child into the world is an honor. This baby would be half my Husband and the legacy He would be leaving to this world. To love this baby wholeheartedly and be a dedicated stay-at-home mom would be an entirely new and different way of serving my Man. 

Of course, there‚Äôs another benefit to being bred. My tits will swell with milk during my pregnancy making them more visually appealing for Men. And once I give birth, they‚Äôll be flowing with sweet, delicious milk. I would work hard to produce enough milk for my Man to enjoy should He want it. I would love to be able to use my body to give Him nourishment. 

I can see myself loving the whole process of being bred so much, that I‚Äôd be happy to turn into His breeding stock. To be filled with loads and loads of cum and pump out babies as many times as He wants me to. So, all this to say that I‚Äôm conflicted about whether I want to be bred or not. But I rest assured knowing that one day I‚Äôll find Him. My Husband, my Dominant, my Daddy, my Master, my God, my entire world in the body of one Man‚Ä¶ and He‚Äôll know the right decision to make. I leave it in His hands.",to breed or not to breed?,2.0,2.0

He was kicked out his halfway house and has been on the streets in London for 10 days.

Is it a good idea to book him a Travelodge for a few days so he can wash and sleep properly?

Anyway - I was wearing the shirt to hang out a load of washing and as I turned around I came face to face with my apartment neighbour (M, teens) who got very excited and fired off about a thousand questions about my interest in the show. I laughed, introduced myself and admitted that it wasn't my shirt, it was my partners and I hadn't actually seen any of the show. 

He got very angry at me; called me a bunch of names including ""fake"", ""slut"", told me that I was ""tease"" for letting people think I had a common interest - etc. I told him it was just a shirt that I wore at home - and that he should not talk to anyone like that and he told me I was the ""reason"" people don't believe women can be interested in ""man's"" stuff. I admittedly said ""fuck off"" and walked off.

Later his dad came up to my apartment and yelled at me for telling a ""child"" to fuck off and then told me not to wear the shirt again because it was upsetting his son and that it was a slutty thing to do. When I asked for clarification I was told ""Wearing a mans shirt is advertising you're fucking him. My child does not need to see that"" and then was also told it was inappropriate that I was wearing it with shorts because it's a longer shirt so it ""looks"" like I'm not wearing pants.

sddmm9,"I (19f) have friends who are a married couple, Jay(19f) and Emily(19f). They are a polyamory couple and they have an open relationship, so they can be with who they please. Now, Jay, likes to be with committed men. She‚Äôs been with many, saying she loves knowing she can get any man she wants and they‚Äôll always choose her. She even went as far as to get one of them to leave his wife for her, then dumped him saying she never wanted anything serious!! Her wife tells her it‚Äôs disgusting to be with a married man especially since none of them have open relationships.

I have a long-term boyfriend (19m) and we‚Äôve been together for 3 years, he has high functioning autism (he wanted me to clarify) and a great partner over all. I trust him with all my heart and soul. We are in a monogamous relationship. My boyfriend, our friends, and I have been friends since high school. 

Onto the issue, last year, Jay went drinking and admitted to me that she wants to sleep with my boyfriend. I told her if she ever tried anything, id never forgive her and I‚Äôd opt out of our friendship. Today she asked me if I could send my boyfriend over to her house to hang out since I was at the gym and my boyfriend stays home as he has crippling anxiety. I told her since her wife isn‚Äôt home (she was with me at the gym) I‚Äôd rather my boyfriend stay home until I get there and then we can all hang out. I thought it would be an easy answer.

She explained that ever since she confessed to me, I‚Äôve been distancing him away from her, and she asked me why. I said we can talk about that later when I get home since I was literally running on a treadmill. 

I get a call from my boyfriend asking me to come home because Jay came over to our house but he gets uncomfortable with anyone unless myself or another party is involved. I go home with Emily to my house. Jay asks me if I have an issue with her being alone with my boyfriend. I was already pissed as I had to leave the gym early so I admit I did kinda lose it. I said ‚Äúwell, you can‚Äôt expect me to fully trust you given your history with committed men, and the fact that you brought up your confession makes it seem like you had ill intentions.‚Äù 

She starts crying saying I don‚Äôt trust her, I remind her that she‚Äôs ruined a lot of our close friends relationships by sleeping with their boyfriends. She ran home crying. She says she‚Äôd never do that to me and I need to apologize or she‚Äôs ending the friendship. Emily is torn because she loves her wife but agrees that I have a point. I‚Äôm wondering if I‚Äôm the AH because I feel like I should just trust her since she‚Äôs one of my closest friends, but I just can‚Äôt. AITA for telling her exactly why I don‚Äôt want her alone with my boyfriend?

sf5psi,"EDIT: To clarify I am not asking for unpopular opinions. I am talking about a specific thing that the fanbase mostly takes as a given but you genuinely don't see it that way. An opinion can encompass a character as a whole, an arc, development, etc. A situation is more isolated. You can have an opinion about a situation but you can have one about other things too.

(I don't mean controversial ones, like Mer and Amelia were awful to Penny or Penny was awful to them, if there is a lot of argument about it, you probably share that thought with some of the fanbase!)

Mine are:

1. I don't think Mark and Lexie's goodbye was romantic, the way Mark spoke to Lexie as she died made me uncomfortable. She is dying and Mark tells her they're going to have this life with a house and kids when literally she always broke up with him because he'd say that shit and she wasn't ready. I know people say Lexie wanted those things with mark eventually and maybe she did but they never had that conversation. Look I'm all for them confessing their love but it honestly felt kinda wrong for their tragic end to include that. It was just like ""oh yeah these things that were an issue for you I'm gonna bring up and you'll now find it romantic cause you're dying."" Something like the Calzona S6 reconciliation where they both said they didn't care, they just wanted the other one, would have been WAY better.
2. (probably slightly less unpopular) Yo Derek getting Webber fired in S6 was NOT a bad thing and it was the RIGHT thing to do. There was some self-interest involved but people WAY overexaggerate it. Derek was always black-and-white, morally, and always quite involved in shit like this, and willing to step in. Even if he wasn't in a position to get the role of chief, I think he would have done something. And as long as Webber wasn't seeking treatment, it didn't matter what precautions he was taking not to hurt people, in the long run, it wouldn't have been enough. Derek did the RIGHT thing and he gets FAR too much hate for it bc he's Derek.

He has been widely condemned.  My guess is that he has had covid recently, and has natural immunity (tested antibodies) for the virus is the basis of the medical exemption.

Regardless the thing that really concerns me though is that Victoria is a state with 92% (over 12) fully vaccinated people.  On Monday that had over 13000 new cases and on Tuesday they had over 17000 new cases.

Isn't the vaccine supposed to minimise the spread?   Surely that's the reason we have these mandate vaccines/covid passes.  In Victoria,

22nd Dec - 2100 new cases.

29th Dec - 5300 new cases

4th Jan - 17500 new cases

Epidemiologically it doesn't make sense, jumping 2100 to 17500 in just 2 weeks.

It does prove that the vaccine does not stop the spread. 

So if it makes no difference to the stop of spreading the disease, then it only personal choice on whether people should get vaccinated or not so that they (might) have less risk of being severely hospitalised/dying.",Novak Djokovic's entry denied to Australia.,2.0,2.0

qcapos,"A few weeks ago I moved to DC for my job and I was lucky enough to find a nice ground level apartment in one of the better parts of town.  My dad drove the Uhaul for me and then stuck around for a few days to sight see.  I had a good time with him here but I was really anxious for him to leave so that I could start taking dick again.  
It was a very early morning on a Monday when I dropped my dad off at the airport and then I got back to my place and immediately starting swiping on the hot local men.  Matches and messages started rolling in and before it was even 8 AM I was bent over on the edge of my bed (pretty much the only thing set up in the apartment at that moment) letting some married daddy type in his late 40s lick my pussy.  He stood up and thrust his raw dick into my eager cunt and within moments I was getting my first load.  He pulled up his pants and said thanks I needed that and left to go to work.  
The next guy I was talking to was about a 10 minute walk away and I had no intention of going except that he said he had a zoom meeting in like 20 minutes and was desperate to nut first so he promised to be quick and use me good so of course I agreed.  I walked to his place and he'd left his door unlocked so I walked all the way in and into his bedroom.  he was on his back, naked, jerking off.  Very handsome guy, nice dick, pretty blue eyes.  I quickly got undressed and got on the bed and started sucking his dick.  He clearly enjoyed it so I did it for a minute or two then he grabbed me and flipped me over so I was facedown and forced my legs open.  It had been less than 30 minutes since the other dude had bred me but I had cleaned up a little.  He licked my pussy from behind for a minute or so and then positioned himself on top of me and pushed into my hot wet cunt.  He held me down roughly and pounded me hard and deep.  Not long afterwards he grabbed both my wrists and held them down above my head and pressed deep and I could feel his dick twitching inside me as another total stranger made me feel like a used whore.  He got off me then rushed me out the door because it was time for his meeting and I had to walk home with his cum running down my leg.  It was 830 AM.
I took a nap when I got home but when I woke up by noon I had a metric fuckton of more messages and throughout the day I took 6 more loads.  And that was day 1.

sglzrq,"Im not gonna write this with grammar at the front of my mind, I'm just trying to put these ideas down.

This has always been my favorite sequence in opera, ever since I was a baby. I absolutely love the drama of this sequence. I think this is where Carmen really starts, because in ""Habanera"" we see her as she wishes to be seen; a little trampy but daring, sexually visible but inaccessible. I think in the ""Au Secours"" sequence, we see this image come slightly undone; the focus, I think, in this sequence is her society and her response to her own reputation as a woman, as a slut, as a ""gypsy girl"", as a pretty much destitute person, and as a criminal among a large group of women of varying social strata.

I don't see this sequence done well very often, and I think this sequence makes or breaks a production. I think if a company does this sequence well, understands its themes, they get the whole effing point of the opera; it is not a celebration of carmens liberation at all. Maybe toward the end it becomes that, but carmen does not start the opera out as a woman who can tell a man no. Maybe she believes she can, maybe she wants everybody to think she can. I dont think she can.

for this sequence I don't like to see a group of beautifully dressed women standing around like it's a choral recital. This is a factory. What are the first things I think of when I think of an 1800‚Äôs cigar factory in Seville, Spain; diverse. Lots of different kinds of women of all different ages and backgrounds. What else would a ""gypsy"" be doing working there? Shes probably not the only woman of color there (moorish women, jewish women). Who knows how long she‚Äôs been working there. She has a reputation. She dresses a little bit slutty (maybe its because she can't buy clothes to dress appropriately for factory work, maybe its calculated; the financial life of a smuggler/prostitute is unpredictable;I don't think its a big deal, though. The girls are mostly poor and the book says a bunch of them actually take off their shirts in the factory because its so stuffy in there). There are poor girls who have a tacit affinity for her, there are girls who are horrified by who she is and the fact that they have to work near her. Other girls pay her no attention and just stay by their own, gossip amongst their own.

So when Carmen gets into a knife fight (i like to imagine that carmen is no bully; she wouldnt pull out a knife on some silly little white girl. I like the idea that she would get into a knife fight with two women and win, fairly), they look at it the way white girls look at poor black girls in a high school who get into knife fights; ""These girls are at it again. These girls are so crazy, what do they even get so worked up over? I cant believe this workplace is so ghetto."" I think some girls are crying from the emotion; its horrifying to see a young girl get cut up in the face. I think some girls are laughing because its a diversion, they are bored with life and with work, they get riled up easily. I like to imagine these bored girls as the mezzos and the sensitive, classy girls (not too classy cuz theyre factory girls) as sopranos.

When the girls run outside there are shouts of horror and shouts of laughter, and I think this is where there is an excuse for a riot. Its not that all the girls are angry at each other. Some girls are running out in the spirit of ‚ÄúLMFAOOO theres a fight going on and bitches are dying LMFAOOO it's a tuesday and bitches are cutting each other up), running pulling up their dresses. I think these girls are chasing the other girls who are running to get the police; i guess they dont want the police involved because they're teenagers and want to be entertained by this fight, but when the good girls go running and crying to the police they want to be brutal and grab the girls and prevent them from getting the police, and if they cant do that theyre gonna switch the story up because F these sensitive hypocritical CVS bougie sopranos. So its the sopranos running out first, the mezzos running after them trying to grab them; little fights are breaking out, the mezzos are taking this as an opportunity to get these annoying good girls and the sopranos are taking this as an opportunity to try their own against these dumb, loud, poor, unclassy girls.

The soldiers are like lol wtf and are kind of annoyed by the public disturbance which is escalating into a riot quickly (boyfriends are getting involved and more boyfriends are getting involved and girls are pulling out knives). I like to imagine that girls are running in and out of the factory to see the riot and see the knife fight inside. I want the blrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrp sound when zunigas like soldads soldads, I want that to be the moment manuelita comes running outside with her face all cut up. I want everybody in the group to be like OMG and gasp. She is rushed to the hospital. I want some really nasty girls to laugh about it, I want some girls to run to her and start crying or shouting in outrage. I want some mezzos to start throwing things at her and I want some sopranos to come and attack, and the soldiers are in between unsuccessfully trying to break things up. When the music is giving the silent, quick flute ""death"" theme, I want carmen to be looking out the window, i want a crowd reaction, and through the window i want the audience to see her being accosted by don jose.

When she comes outside with guards at her arms, her name is being called out (the big carmencita moment) and I want some girls to laugh and some girls to start trying to throw stuff at her and point their fingers and yell. Instead of a fight or a moment where people are standing around, I want this musical climax to be Carmen trying to run away.. She knws she is about to be arrested and I don't like the idea that she would get arrested and risk going to jail just because she's so sure she can seduce don jose and escape the scene with a boyfriend. She is not a witch, there is no such thing. She is petrified. She tries to escape and some soldiers grab her, and another big riotous brawl breaks out all around her and the apprehending guards as they rush her into the barracks for the little ""trial"". She sings her tralala and then at the next big msucial climax ""when hes like 'prison!'"", I want her to try and run away again, get caught by some factory girls and taken back into the barracks.

 The guards decide this really is enough and literally start to throw the girls back into the factory. The fun is over anyway. When she is locked away she is legitimately concerned for herself. Seducing don jose is definitely not the first thing she thinks of. I think its a successful after thought and she happens to catch feelings for him because he is exceptionally pure and egalitarian minded and handsome; hes from the navarre, where girls are people too, and she notices that immediately, even if the only way she knows how to talk to him is by trying to seduce him with sex and an invitation to a tavern where she strips every weekend for like ten bucks.

I really don't like the idea that Carmen is the queen of the world. She is a chronically disempowered young girl. In the book she is a sex slave and was bought in marriage by a man 20 years her senior at the age of 12, and he doubles as her PIMP. she only knows how to move around with a man at her side. What happens when there happens to be no man (in the book her husband/pimp is in jail)? she has to live in a tavern where she is pimped out every night, she has to do factory work just like everybody else, where she runs the risk of being knifed by other disempowered girls and everybody looks at her like she is cancer. So many productions have this riot happening all around her and she remains totally untouched. they forget that this girl is a social pariah, and that reality is not as glamourous as a beautiful woman wearing red and giving seductive smiles wtih a knife in her hand; very few girls are on her side, and these girls are poorer than the others, so they naturally sympathize with the one called a dirty, loud slut. If she is gonna pull out a knife, it is not to impress Jose. I think she is as angry as the other girls. I wouldnt even consider it too dramatic if she's crying, too. She lives on the brink of life and death and she probably hates factory work as much as the next girl. She has some boy smuggler friends around town who can probably help her eat or take her to the next city or give her some really degrading work as a smuggler/prostitute; she is nottttt a mafiasa.","Notes on Bizet's ""Au Secours"" Sequence in Carmen",2.0,2.0

1.  is it true?
2. why is it true? Where in the rules can I see justification for this. A sweep is defined as a player starting from guard inverting the position and ending up on top. How is ""seated guard"" a guard if there is no contact between your legs and your opponent? It seems like a guard must incorporate the use of one's legs in order to prevent the opponent from gaining a position on you.
3. What if you dont even push the person and instead they voluntarily sit down and your stand up? I think I've seen points awarded for this but sometimes I wonder if the refs are actually awarding points for some other esoteric intersection of like 3 obscure rules I've never heard of.","Why does pushing someone down from ""seated"" guard count as a sweep?",2.0,2.0

So.. you're mad because someone has multiple posts that people *chose* to like?

You're really that mad and sensitive at the fact someone posts relevant content to multiple subreddits, so they could share the content they seen with multiple communities so they could enjoy it too.. why? What does someone else's account have to do with you? What does someone else's karma have to do with you? Why does it matter if the person has 10 karma points or a thousand? How and why does that dictate the quality of content posted? Why does that dictate someone's worth?

People love to say karma is pointless, karma doesn't matter, but then be the biggest bitchers and complainers when it comes to someone being a ""karma whore"". People love to say karma doesn't matter but be the biggest downvoters. Lol. 
If it don't matter, why go out of your way to worry about it and someone else's? 

This whole idea of being a karma whore is stupid. This whole idea of banning/deleting someone because they have a lot of karma is stupid. Reddit puts so much emphasis on karma in its subreddits yet they hate people that actually get it. 

If the person is posting *relevant* content to the subreddit while following the subreddits rules, why hate them for what they personally choose to do? Their karma has no affect on anybody else. Period. It isn't like they scammed or conned the karma either; they are literally free upvotes that people *choose* to give... so you're hating someone because people chose to upvote content that they like?

Don't be mad because someone posts something to multiple subreddits. There's nothing wrong with posting things to multiple subreddits that could enjoy the content instead of hoarding it to one subreddit. People really hate others because they are being social, active and interacting with an assortment of subreddits instead of just two. 

And honestly a lot of the time the people hating have little karma and are just feeling petty and jealous because you post things people actually like while they sit at 20k for 2 years ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Like quit hating on people because they have free and ultimately pointless internet points that people chose to give because they enjoyed the content shared. Quit acting victim because someone posted content to your subreddit that people enjoy. Who gives a fuck if it's been posted to other subreddits? How does it affect you, your account or your life? The whole point of Reddit is to be a social media so quit hating on people being social. It just seems like an ignorant thing to hate on when you have people in these subreddits sharing negativity and being hateful. Go worry about them and not someone just trying to share content. Be happy someone posted in your subreddit at all. Period. 

People really gotta start minding their own business and really looking at themselves and the shit they be hating on. Who cares if someone has 500k karma? Good for them. That doesn't affect me or their content at all. It doesn't change whether the content is good or enjoyable. It doesn't change anything. And the person with the karma? Karma is ultimately pointless. Hating on someone because of free internet points is stupid and petty. They can't do anything with the karma to begin with so quit hating someone for having it. It isn't like someone is getting all this karma and getting paid for it. It isn't like the person is taking karma away from someone else (karma has an unlimited supply, it isn't some economic situation). There's plenty of free karma to go around for everybody so being petty because someone has a lot of it is pointless. 

Again quit worrying about some imaginary number. If anything having a large amount of karma is a good thing; it shows the person is active, being social, engaging with and helping communities while also posting content people obviously enjoy, opposed to the countless profiles that just post BS people don't like at all. 

There's other things, other people and better people to be mad about it instead of something posting shit people like and choose to upvote. It just seems Reddit had a backwards view on a lot of things and then pointlessly/excessively get mad about others. It is what it is. It's reddit. Just wanted to post this rant.

s2an5q,"I don‚Äôt know why I was ever so shy about my body or myself in general, but this is so much more fun. Just turned 20 a few months ago and since I came to college I‚Äôve been trying to cut loose on my uptight, shy nature and really try to get out there. I joined a sorority, never turn down party invites, etc. and while it was hard at first to adjust, I think maybe I‚Äôve adjusted too well. 

It all changed when I was at my first frat party. I didn‚Äôt know what to wear and how to act so I let my sorority sisters dress me and guide me. I think maybe they were trying to tease me or prank me a little bit because they put me in this really short denim skirt. I was really not used to this kind of thing and I protested but they insisted and I decided to trust them. After all, this wasn‚Äôt my expertise. 

At the party, not even an hour into attending, I was pulled into a bedroom, had my panties ripped open, and was fucked mercilessly on the bed by some random guy, hardly saw his face. I mean, POUNDED into the bed. He came twice in me and left. I was too embarrassed to tell anyone about being fucked so I walked home with his cum dripping down my thighs. 

That was sort of my awakening. I woke up horny as hell the next day. It was the hottest thing I had ever done and I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about it. I got off to it like three times the next day. It was like a dam had broken when he had taken my virginity that night. This was my first year of college‚Äîlast year‚Äîand since then I‚Äôve become known as the slut of my sorority house. I never turn anything down. I just get so excited about sex of any kind that it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm incapable of controlling myself.

I eat out my sorority sisters whenever they ask me to, like a personal sex toy. I will literally drop what i‚Äôm doing and lick their pussies. They all have such pretty little cunts and they all just taste so good, I could do it for hours. I let random people at the bar and the club fuck me. I go in short skirts without panties as a default. I let one guy fuck his cock into me in the middle of a dance floor. I‚Äôve fucked a homeless man before because I caught him jerking off in an alley. I will do anything, and lately my desires have become more and more taboo and filthy. Sometimes it seems like i‚Äôll get to the point where I have no limits and will
go for anything, no matter how filthy and wrong. I don‚Äôt really know if I even want to stop it from happening.","Just turned [20F] and quickly degenerating into a total whore, and I‚Äôm having the time of my life",1.0,2.0

All I can do to show gratitude at this time is say thank you. My electric bill is paid and my day has turned for the better immensely. This was never a scam, I guess I was being naive a bit when I originally posted. I never expected such an intense response. I never expected anyone to offer to help. I was at my wits end when I woke up this morning and felt like I finally reached a breaking point. Now I can say if you were skeptical towards the post, I understand. But to the trolls in my messages, I feel sorry for you. To the few who told me I should kill myself so my kids can be adopted to a better home, you should be ashamed of yourself. If you want to cashapp towards my family, send me a private msg or take your trollness elsewhere. I was nearing a panic attack. I work very hard every day, I smile when I want to cry. My boys have not gone a day without something, or feeling the need. My life is hard, but everyone deals with things. My circumstances are shitty at times, but I have a good job and learned to make do with what I have. I am good, we are good!!! And again, thank you for all the kindness. Some asked for me to post my Venmo or cashapp, even my Amazon wishlist, but I would rather you kind ppl give to another who feels lost or desperate. Much love to good ppl still left out there, you mean more to me than words can explain. 

ORIGINAL POST:: Please don't judge me, I'm at my wits end. I'm now at the point of no return. I find myself creating a Reddit account to let out my thoughts. 
Mom of young twin boys, lost their dad tragically when my boys were infants. Somehow I have managed to make it through life since then, even with such a big piece of my heart gone. I don't ask for sympathy or anything, just venting. 
I've lived on a tight budget for a few years now, there have been plenty of times I've ate a piece of bread for the day in order to avoid my babies going without. I just can't do it anymore. 
I'm counting wipes, portioning food, doing any and everything to survive. There have been so many days I wanted to quit, but I refuse. Most people would look at me and assume I have my shit together, I hear it all the time. Little do they know the simplest things are so hard for me at times.
Well last day to pay my electric bill before its turned off is tomorrow. I somehow let it slip, shit happens. But knowing it's an absolute necessity and knowing I don't really have anyone to turn to, I feel like my backs against the wall. I have a male co-worker who has offered to ""help"" me with some money, but of course that comes with a big cost to me, MY BODY! 
I feel disgusting even thinking about it. I've made it so far and done it by myself for the most part, but life happens. I refuse to let my kids feel any type of pain or suffering because I'm broke, I refuse to let them go without. I need basic needs like pull ups, groceries, and my electric bill paid... so tonight I will do what I have to do. 
Again, I beg to not be judged. I needed to vent and thought this would be a good outlet since it's anonymous. I know I have to live with this decision for the rest of my life, but at least I will know my boys will have what they need until my next paycheck.
Have a great day to all who made it through my confession. I already feel like shit about it just sending the msg to set the date up for this evening, I don't know if I have the strength to make it through the  day, but I pray a lot and will pray that this too shall pass.","Hard times call for tough choices, selling myself to make ends meet",2.0,2.0

ruztq2,"I love thinking about the behind-the-scenes framework that undergirds a story, and that made the Endwalker MSQ a delightful experience. Going into the expansion, Ishikawa and the writing team faced three thorny and difficult issues, ones that have sidetracked and damaged a lot of other stories. They somehow managed to handle all three with panache, and I wanted to take some time to discuss how they pulled it off.

1. **Fanservice for the Finale**

Yikes this is a terrifying dilemma to face. Endwalker is the conclusion of a 10-year storyline, so everyone expects it to tie off or engage the many, many storylines that have come before. References and callbacks were mandatory, not optional, so the writers had to sculpt a story that could logically cross paths with the characters from trial, raid, alliance raid, beast quest, and job storylines, *without* turning it into a generic, directionless soup. References have to be substantive enough to delight fans of that content, but not so intrusive that they hurt the experience for those who are less invested.

In Endwalker, there is one scene that is a perfect example of everything that can go wrong when writing fanservice: the weird first-person cutscene while waiting for Ryne in the First. It‚Äôs just a succession of characters we met in Shadowbringers popping in, saying hi, and leaving. It doesn‚Äôt really make sense they‚Äôd all be strolling past this one doorway, they don‚Äôt have anything meaningful to say, and Feo Ul in particular just spouts a bunch of catch-phrases before uncharacteristically bailing. It‚Äôs fanservice at its shallowest, emptiest, and most obligatory.

I was worried the entire expansion would be full of awkward, pointless scenes like this, but instead, they do an astounding job weaving in previous characters without slowing down the narrative. The introduction to the Ilsabard Contingent is a fantastic example. If someone boosted up to Endwalker, they would watch this cutscene and think ‚Äúokay, this region is led by this person and brings this to the table.‚Äù But a veteran player will recognize all kinds of characters from the job quests. Only the most vital characters are voiced and re-introduced, and everyone else stays in the background. They don‚Äôt beat us over the head with it, they just have our old allies present to storm Garlemald.

In the same way, the Scions put out a call for help to power the *Ragnarok,* and Eorzea and Othard answer. What follows is pure, unadulterated, 100% fanservice, but they construct the narrative so that it makes perfect sense. Tenzen‚Äôs Phoenix Blade *would* be extremely helpful to us, but Seiryu would *also* want to ensure it‚Äôs safety. Of course Emmanellain would reach out to the Sky Pirates, who else would know about illicit goods and be able to track them down? These are meaningful moments because it allows all those we‚Äôve helped to repay the favor in our own hour of need.

1. **A Breakout Star**

We were introduced to a ton of new characters in Shadowbringers, but one of them stole the show: Emet-Selch, histrionic keeper of sorrow! Emet-Selch was always intended to carry the emotional stakes of Shadowbringers, but he took the community by storm and swiftly became one of the most beloved villains in the entire Final Fantasy series. The demand for Endwalker was clear: more Emet-Selch.

Anyone who‚Äôs seen the Pirates of the Caribbean movies knows how badly this can go wrong. A lot of memorable, incongruous characters only work because they don‚Äôt fit the setting; that‚Äôs why they stand out. When these characters get so popular they *become* the setting, they cease to function. Emet-Selch was great as a melodramatic asshole who showed up to make snarky comments at irregular intervals before betraying us and becoming the expansion‚Äôs big bad. But besides a few key moments, we did not spend a lot of time with him. The writers knew they had to keep the amount of time we spend being called clueless inferior losers to a minimum, because an all-powerful, unkillable being who only exists to treat you like shit is an inherently frustrating presence in a story. I think we only have three or four conversations with Emet-Selch in the 25-hours of story before the finale; that‚Äôs how carefully they rationed him.

In Endwalker, they wanted to have an entire plotline dedicated to Emet-Selch: hours of story with him not as a villain you are trying to kill, but an ally you are supposed to cooperate with. This should have been a complete disaster; imagine hours of Emet-Selch calling you an idiot, sending you on a fetch quest, and then calling you an insubstantial weakling before sending you on another fetch quest. That‚Äôs who his character *is*, they can‚Äôt have him behave any differently, but god would it get tiresome after a few quests.

The writers solve this problem with a single, genius inclusion: Hythlodaeus. They made Hythlo a perfect counter to Emet, as cheerful as he is cynical, as warm as he is suspicious, as laidback as he is uptight. Whenever Emet belittles and puts down the player, Hythlo swoops in and laughs at him, belittling Emet in turn. This cancels out his attitude so that instead of Emet coming off as cruel and abusive, he just comes across as grumpy and a little comical. Once you know what to look for, you can‚Äôt unsee it: every time Emet says something to us in Elpis, Hythlo undercuts him like clockwork. It also gives them a great dynamic that retroactively reinforces Shadowbringers: you can totally see why Hythlo‚Äôs shade was given a little extra sentience by Emet-Selch, and why he might act against Emet‚Äôs stated desires.

By preemptively neutering his character, Square gets to have their cake and eat it too. We get more classic, snarky Emet, but in a new context that makes him seem endearing rather than grating. Towards the end of the Elpis arc, I was so struck by how good a team we made with Emet, Hythlo, and Venat, and Square sealed the deal by making them Trust characters. I‚Äôm sure it took a lot of work to program them as Trust NPC‚Äôs, and some developers wondered if it was all worth it for a single dungeon. But doing it put them on the same level as our Scion friends in the most concrete and unmistakable way, emphasizing the point of the Elpis arc in the best way possible.

1. **An Unpopular Villain**

Square had the opposite problem with a certain blond fuckboy: Zenos yae Galvus, heir to the Garlean throne and our alleged arch-nemesis. He was the main villain in Stormblood, and most of the build-up to Endwalker is spent on him, personally. I bet he was always intended to be a decoy villain, but even given that, it‚Äôs clear Square expected Zenos to carry a lot of the story‚Äôs weight as a major villain. That means things got real dicey when it became clear that many players didn‚Äôt really care about him at all.

The problem was not that players hated Zenos; hated villains are great! Even when it‚Äôs for the wrong reasons (bad writing, cheesy dialogue), it‚Äôs still the right emotion pointed in the right direction; it gives you as a writer a lot to work with. No, the problem was that not enough players hated him. A small percentage had strong feelings about him either way, but the majority was just‚Ä¶.indifferent. They weren‚Äôt invested in him as a character, they did not accept him as our arch-nemesis, and worst of all, they were not really looking forward to our final showdown. This was a complete disaster, it meant all of the build-up that took place over an entire expansion was essentially wasted. So with the clock ticking down and it being too late to scrap him, what was Square to do?

I feared they would go with a seemingly obvious solution: incite hatred by having Zenos kill a bunch of Scions. It makes him threatening, heightens the stakes, makes our beef personal; what‚Äôs not to like? Well, it wouldn‚Äôt fix any of Zenos‚Äô problems as a character. He‚Äôd still be a shallow and cartoonish villain, out of place among XIV‚Äôs rounded and deep cast of villains. He would still be outrageously powerful for no reason, and a massacre would only call attention to his inexplicable strength. Worst of all, he still would have no relevance to the broader Hydaelyn vs. Zodiark plotline. It would be a ham-fisted move, doubling down on all of Zenos questionable writing for no benefit.

Instead, Ishikawa and co did something quite brilliant: they owned it. They leaned into all of the complaints people had with him as a character, and made them into an arc. They had Zenos bring up the fact that we already beat him once, and didn‚Äôt have any reason to fear him anymore. They had characters tell Zenos to his face that his motivations were shallow and kind of stupid, not really worth taking seriously. Most importantly, Zenos himself recognizes that he isn‚Äôt really connected to the bigger plot, and his beef with us feels like a pointless distraction from much more important shit. In doing so, Square took themselves out of the equation: instead of Zenos being our plot-mandated rival, he began to stand on his own as a sad, empty figure, someone with no idea how to get what he wanted.

This didn‚Äôt really make Zenos sympathetic, but it gave depth to his character for the first time. And Square realized that there was a place in the broader story for Zenos: right at the end, when his cartoonishly high opinion of us could be a welcome counterpoint to Metieon‚Äôs overwhelming despair‚Ä¶if he came in on our side. When he crashed our fight with the Endsinger at the eleventh hour, all dragoned-up and saying ‚ÄúCome on man, you‚Äôre a badass, why haven‚Äôt you killed her already?‚Äù I was so happy to see him. And that is not something I *ever* thought I would say about Zenos yae Galvus.

Zenos decision to help us totally changed my opinion of his character. Every time he had given his ‚Äúwe‚Äôre the same, you and I,‚Äù speech before, I had rolled my eyes out of my head, but there at the edge of the galaxy, after we‚Äôd worked together to take down the greatest threat to life in the universe, I was finally willing to tell him what he‚Äôd always wanted to hear: *you‚Äôre right.* I thought our showdown with Zenos would feel like a chore, but when it finally arrived, I loved every minute of it. I was dreading Zenos clogging up the MSQ, but he wound up being one of the highlights of the expansion for me.

Three really tricky problems, any one of which could have majorly dragged down Endwalker‚Äôs narrative. Instead, the writing team handled them all masterfully, and turned several likely pitfalls into some of the expansions' biggest strengths. Endwalker‚Äôs story was actually dragged down by much more basic storytelling errors, but that‚Äôs a post for another time; today, I wanted to give Square Enix credit for some really impressive work.","Endwalker‚Äôs MSQ has its flaws, but it got three very tricky storytelling challenges right.",2.0,2.0

s2hgmk,"I had an appointment to get my 2nd shingles vaccine at my local pharmacy.  When I arrived there was a line of 5-6 people in front of me at the counter.   Behind the counter there were 3 pharmacists working their butts off, covering the drive-through, dispensing meds and giving shots.

Beside the counter is a small private booth thing where they vaccinate people and beside that is a small seating area where you are supposed sit and wait after getting your shot.

Sitting in one of the chairs was an older man, likely in his 70s;  mask down under his nose, coughing and wheezing into a handkerchief  His bloated, swollen ankles and feet made him a poster boy for uncontrolled diabetes.

As the line advanced, one of the women in line turned to the man and said Hello to him.  As she was wearing a mask, he did not recognize her, so they both took off their masks to chat. 

After a round of ‚Äúhow were your holidays?‚Äù the woman asked him what he was doing at the pharmacy. He replied he was getting a Covid vaccine.  ‚ÄúWhy would you do that?‚Äù was her response.

The man then went into a long rant about how his 50-year old adult son, who had ‚Äúsevere downs syndrome‚Äù was in the ICU with Covid. He said the hospital would not let him in to visit his son unless he was vaccinated.

Think about this for a moment.   He only got the shot because of the ICU‚Äôs requirement.  Not after the shots being available for over a year.  Not after his son got covid. Only after the doctor said he can‚Äôt visit unless he is vaccinated.

The woman then said she would pray for his son.  At this point the lady directly in line in front of me chimes in with ‚ÄúAmerica needs more prayer‚Äù.

The three of them then decided to form a prayer circle.  They all held hands and chanted some prayer they all knew that said something about ‚ÄúGod being in control‚Äù and ‚Äúwe are not worthy to question his judgement‚Äù.

These two women held hands a prayed with a man who was coughing,  wheezing and  obviously ill. A man who had just told them he was in close contact with somebody with Covid.

As this was going on the pharmacist was calling out ‚ÄúNext in line please‚Äù.  When the women in the prayer circle did not notice, she motioned for me to approach the counter.

As I stepped up to the counter to tell them I had an vaccination appointment one of the prayer ladies went full Karen on the pharmacist, yelling that she was there first and it was not fair to let me jump the line.

The pharmacist just looked at her and said ‚ÄúYou were busy‚Äù and continued do deal with me.  I was given a clipboard and asked to fill in some questions.  I took the form and went to the other side of the store, as far away from these people as I could, to fill it in.  I was seriously ready to strangle her.

When I returned, the old man was gone as was the Karen.  The ‚ÄúAmerica needs more prayer‚Äù lady was now arguing with the pharmacist about getting her new health insurance information loaded into the system.   The pharmacist asked her to come back another time as they were very busy dealing with ""real patients"" but in the end she spent 10 minutes loading her and her husband‚Äôs information while everybody in line glared at her.

This is why we can‚Äôt have nice things.  This is why this pandemic is still here. These fucking people are the reason.

Most people in the comments and dms told me I should tell him everything but I just couldn‚Äôt do it. I have been trying and wanting to tell him everyday since I found out but I just can‚Äôt. We ended up breaking up though. A few days ago I told him I wanted to break up and he actually agreed. There wasn‚Äôt any arguing or fighting, he didn‚Äôt ask me why and I didn‚Äôt ask him, it was over just like that. Honestly I didn‚Äôt know how to feel about it all, the whole conversation lasted like 10 minutes and I thought it would last hours, us talking and figuring out things but it wasn‚Äôt like that.

He seemed relieved and asked how soon I would be going. I didn‚Äôt want to stay because it would be weird and I left the next day while he was at work. Packed my things in my car and drove around for a while, not sure where to go. I ended up booking a hotel for a while until I get a new place and that‚Äôs where I am now. I still have a job so I‚Äôm okay that way, I work with his sister so I think that‚Äôs going to be weird. Might have to work somewhere else.

As for the dad, again most people told me I should tell him and I did. We met and I just told him right away. He didn‚Äôt say anything for a bit and looked sort of panicked. We ended up talking for a long time about how it would work out. He said he wasn‚Äôt sure if he could handle the responsibility and I‚Äôm okay with that. I want to have the baby, I don‚Äôt want to kill a baby, abortion is such a difficult decision to make. I told him if he doesn‚Äôt want a part in the baby‚Äôs life that‚Äôs okay I just really want my baby to have a dad I guess. He offered that I could stay with him instead of a hotel but I said no. I felt it would be wrong. I think he wants to continue our affair but I don‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt really want to have a relationship with him.

I went and saw my doctor too, about the baby. I‚Äôve been put in contact with people and given advice so that‚Äôs a relief.","Update - I cheated and I‚Äôm pregnant, I don‚Äôt know what to do",2.0,2.0

ryg7z9,"Now we all the know the dating market is screwed (for men especially). But instead of debating about how screwed it is. What do you think are some solutions to fixing it or at least to keep it from getting any worse? One good way to start, would be make prostitution legal, even though this solution would not be the end all be all, it is a good start to helping this terrible market.

***Reason Why***

To start most humans are shallow(to varying degrees), and have very specific reasons/priorities for why they date. [For women its resources and validation, and for men its consistent sex(having a hot partner)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/255692691_Mate_Preferences_Do_Predict_Attraction_and_Choices_in_the_Early_Stages_of_Mate_Selection). Now, part of the reason for why the dating market is so fucked and [there are more romantically inclined men than there are women](https://imgur.com/a/Z8GpfRd), is because women have access(due to women empowerment and online mediums) to their needed resources and validation. Therefore women don't need to date and can leave the dating market. This creates a disproportionate ratio between men and women in the market, giving the women left over a higher demand than they previously had(This is why even fat women have no issue finding partners for dating/sex, [just look at a show like hot&heavy for evidence](https://imgur.com/a/n8Dz3P3) of that). So we need a way for men to leave the market like women did.

***How It Helps***

So we know why men date. [But we also know that men have a higher sex drive than women.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/238048296_Is_There_a_Gender_Difference_in_Strength_of_Sex_Drive_Theoretical_Views_Conceptual_Distinctions_and_a_Review_of_Relevant_Evidence) That's why Tinder became a hook up app because and [why the ratio is so disproportionate on the app.](https://www.netimperative.com/2019/04/05/online-dating-trends-men-outnumber-women-on-tinder-by-9-to-1-while-grinder-wins-for-age-diversity/) Even non-app hookup apps like hinge have this problem. Therefore we need an outlet for these men to have their sexual desires filled. This is where legalizing prostitution comes in. The reason prostitution is not viable right now is because its illegal and a lot of men don't have access to it. And for the men that do its still hard to find good sex workers because of the amount fakes and sting operations that are in the profession. So if we make prostitution legal the men who only want sex won't have to worry and they won't waste their time with dating apps. This evens out the ratio of men and women on the app who actually want a relationship, and more women will be incentivized to join, since they won't have to deal with men trying to hookup with them. This can be proven with places like Australia where people have an easier time with dating and less men simp for women on onlyfans.

***Conclusion***

Although I realize its not the perfect solution its a good way to begin fixing this screwed dating market that creates subs like these, [r/FDS](https://www.reddit.com/r/FDS/) , [r/redpill](https://www.reddit.com/r/redpill/), and [r/mgtow](https://www.reddit.com/r/mgtow/).

s65sby,"We are the perfect match in every way except one. But I (24 M) ignored that because I loved her (23 F) so much and still do. But now I feel trapped and don't know what to do and just need a void to vent to. 

Sexually we are basically incompatible. She is happy with sex 1-2 times a month, doesn't masturbate, is incredibly vanilla, and still after 5 years together blushes when I say the word sex. I on the other hand would prefer 6-10 times a week or more, am incredibly kinky, and have been bottling all that up for 5 years blaming our lack of a private space on why our sex was so basic and infrequent. 

But now with two years married and living in our own place. Trying everything from subtle hints to direct conversations explaining my need for more physical intimacy I am trapped. She simply doesn't have a libido or kinkiness remotely close to me. And there is nothing wrong with that. Everyone is different but I need more physical intimacy but I courted her, I proposed to her, and I promised to be her rock forever. And now I don't know what to do. I still want to be her rock but I can't deny an entire part of myself. And so here I am on an anonymous reddit account screaming into the void because I don't know what to do. I see no way it gets better for me without hurting her...

Edit: So I woke up from my nap and can't possibly respond to everyone so I will try and address what I have seen as major points in the comments/messages I have received. 

- I do not think she is broken/wrong for having a lower sex drive and not being kinky. I fully understand that I ignored our incompatibility because I cared for her and this is 100% my own hole I've dug.

- On the flip side I am not wrong either for having the drive that I do. It is part of who I am with my kinks an my drive. Just like suggesting she take drugs to increase hers, taking drugs to kill mine will probably never happen. 

- I am probably exaggerating with the 6-10 times a week but even if we hit 2x a week that would be 4-5x our current average and while that would probably be fine for me we've never gotten close. 

- For those who suggested I may be selfish in sex and so she doesn't enjoy it. This is a fair point but I am confident not a concern here. A major kink of mine is making my partner orgasm. Especially multiple times if possible. I have never had an issue with this with my current wife or previous partners. I will say with my current wife it has been the most difficult as other then PIV sex she is hesitant to try even basic foreplay let alone toys. 

Hopefully this clears somethings up for some people. To everyone that is making honest suggestions thank you. I will take them into consideration and try and see what we can do.",I Messed Up Marrying My Wife,2.0,2.0

sfm6m3,"We are born, and at first we are completely innocent and pure like the original players Adam and Eve, but sooner or later the Ego Game begins... the Ego Game *must* begin or other people will immediately lose to you, and no one likes losing the Ego Game to a hotshot upstart that never even played before.  Beginner's luck?  Sometimes, but that's totally against the rules and you'll probably get crucified between Boardwalk and Park Place just to even the score.  But I digress... I choose the Top Hat.

We see from these eyes and experience things from this body, so *of course* we're the center of the universe and the ego wants everything for this ""self""... *collect $50 from every player*.  Damn, that feels good, doesn't it?  And parents inevitably teach the Ego Game to children as soon as they can... *you are special and precious!  No one in the world is as special and precious as you.  My precious!  PRECIOOOOOUS*.  Or even worse, they show you in some terrible way that you are worthless because that's what they were shown, but that sometimes evens out because it can create some *really* great players.  Some parents tried but all ultimately failed and we are broken, *forgive them for they know not what they do*, so here we are trying to win it all and get the high score before Game Over, man, Game OVER!  *Do you wish to continue, Player One?*  *That will be one quarter*... but where's the god damn slot?!  I want to play again!!

So then as we ""grow up"", the Ego Game gets more serious and the stakes get even higher.  Newsflash: none of us are born or really grow up and there are no stakes, but you didn't hear that from me.  Or did you?  *Checkmate*.  We now return to our regularly scheduled programming... *What's mine is mine, and I'll take yours if I can so I can have more.  I deserve it because you are not as special as me...  All In*.  We go about only looking for things to confirm what we already believe and like, and our ego immediately rejects anything to the contrary even if one hundred percent true.  Truth^(TM) is not allowed in the Ego Game either, move back three spaces...

Ego sometimes meets ego in the arena, and a great clash of egos ensues in Mortal Combat: *I am right because I am here, and you are wrong because your opinions displease me, thus you are below me.  Are you not entertained!?* The Emperor gives a thumbs down.  *FINISH HIM!!*

Then the Ego Game might get even more serious: prizes like cars and houses are sometimes not enough, so some of the really great players of the game go searching in the direction of *even more*, universally so, because why the hell not?  Spirituality ensues!  *I want to live forever and I want a Righteousness bonus, so I introduce the God Card into the game!*  Hey wait a minute... I'm Awakened +3 with an Intuition modifier, so I play the Projection Card *and* the Ego Card!  *Everything is Uno, don't you know?*

And whoops, looks like yet another player has landed on Messiah Complex^(TM), *go directly to Padded Room, do not collect $200*.  Just Visiting...

So tell me, how does one ultimately win the Ego Game?  Is that even possible?  How does one get off of the great spinning wheel of life and death and stop throwing the loaded dice that *always* comes up craps no matter who plays?  The Monopoly money isn't real, we're out of houses and hotels, and even Jesus got pissed and flipped the table at one point.  *Just stop playing*.  Or is this all ego yet again? ü§î",Let me tell you about the Ego Game... üé≤üé≤,2.0,2.0
s2b8gb,"I had to drop off some stock for work to a location in town (inner Dublin) this afternoon. The location had a drop-off point so I pulled in threw, on the hazard lights and dropped off the stock.

Once I was done I got back in the car and saw I had a text from my boss asking him to ring me. As I rang him I noticed the phone ringing in my hand, I realized that since the car was turned off I wasn't connected to the Bluetooth Handsfree.

I turned on the car and placed the phone down in one of the car pockets while it automatically connected. Everything worked perfect and I finished my conversation with my boss using the handsfree as I pulled out of the space and onto the road and turned off hazards.

Just as I pulled out the conversation ended and I hung up. Seconds later there was a knock on my window and a Guard on a bike motioned me to pull in.

I did so and he took my license and wrote me up.  I didn't want to argue with the man just doing his job but I made sure to say to him that I was on a call but I was using the car's handsfree. He insisted that once the phone was in my hand then its illegal and results in a fine and 3 points.


I have received points before and paid fines before but they were instances I was in the wrong, this time I don't think I did anything illegal. The only time the phone was in my hand was when I put it into the car's pocket and that was before I was even driving. Can anyone clear up the laws around driving with Bluetooth handsfree?

I've never appealed points before and seen some people on reddit say it's a waste of time and will only cost you more. I don't mind the fine but as a new driver the penalty points are very damaging and make me consider appealing it.

I've contacted some solicitors but none of them are very helpful without paying their consultation fee. Does anyone know if I have a case? I don't want to pay 200 euro to be told there's nothing to do just pay the fine.

He gets in a bad mood if he can't pray. He prays daily. He doesn't drink alcohol which is not a big deal, but never in your whole life even trying bacon because you think you will go to hell, is mind blowing to me. 

At the same time, even though he claims he is part of this faith, he says he doesn't support / ignores the verses where it says homosexuals should be killed, where it says a good woman is an obedient one. Also of course he ignores the rule where it says sex before marriage is a sin, etc. So how can you be a follower of this faith if you don't believe in those parts? Isn't it against your faith to be not following everything written in the holy text? Isn't this hypocrisy? 

He wants to take his future children to the place of worship and teach them the holy texts, because this is the only way they can learn to be good humans. The End.

And oh yeah he thinks if a woman is wearing shorts, short skirt, this is a shame to her man, and she should be wearing modest clothing...

sfmndm,"So freddy_birdy on insta wrote a post saying ""The clothes will get tinier as the gehraiyaan release date approaches"" which lead to this outrage about how he has basically slut shammed deepika, I personally think that's not the case. Firstly, I do agree the post was about deepika specifically and has nothing to do with ananya ( cause frankly she has no pop culture impact for people to even notice what she is wearing). 

Now, I don't think he meant to slut shame deepika, the post was just a commentary on the one thing that has overtaken the top spot in gehraiyaan promotions from day 1, that is deepika's fashion choices for the press events. The outfits are bad for two reasons in my opinion (again, y'all can disagree )

A - This movie was deepika's play to be taken seriously as an actress but her clothes in the press junkets make it appear as if she is promoting some trashy teen rom com rather than a sophisticated domestic noir. Frankly, it was distracting and cringe seeing her doing serious interviews wearing those party dresses that belonged for a fun club date

B - The clothes have become the main talking point of the whole press campaign with nothing else being in the spotlight (maybe that's what deepika wanted but it's really a disservice to the actual film and it's seriousness). The clothes stood out for all the bad reasons and got people talking, even comparing her to urfi javed. 

Now, Freddy's post was a commentary on this, he used the word tiny that seems sexist and harsh but then there are no rules in comedy. For example, comedians in West would often use punchlines like ""dressed like a hooker"" etc for jokes. It's meant to be shocking and a little provocative. 

Some will say who is he to tell her what to wear but then in that case, this sub will close down if we didn't had opinions on celebs. For example, lady gaga is currently doing a very cringe Oscar campaign for house of gucci and social media is full of jokes about her and how she is going overboard. That's what pop culture is, people gonna talk. Gaga can say whatever she wants, but similarly people gonna have a reaction too. Similarly, deepika can wear anything but people will have something to say about it as well. I just don't know how deepika is being seen as some sort of victim here, comedy is all about punching up and not down. It's crazy how people are being hounded for even liking that post. Freddy no where said, that she is shameless for wearing such clothes or has no morals etc, it was just an observation about her fashion choices specifically for gehraiyaan, that's all",Unpopular Opinion: Freddy wasn't slut shaming deepika in that gehraiyaan post,2.0,2.0

rtkzk5,"I (56M) have a son (28M) who spent a lot of time traveling overseas in his college years. He went all around the world, including several trips to the Middle East, where he studied for his minor in Arabic language and literature.

A few years ago, my son found out that a woman he knew in Pakistan had a son (9M). She claimed this son was his, which I doubted. My son, however, believed her without question. He asked this woman to send her son to the US to stay with my son so they could get to know each other. He has spent the last few summers here.

Recently, the boy moved in with my son fulltime, a decision I strongly urged against. My son enrolled him in the same private school we sent him to at that age, which is very expensive. I have tried to support my son's decision, but it has been hard. I really want my son to get a DNA test, but he stubbornly keeps refusing.

Recently, things came to a head at a family dinner my son invited us to. He said the boy was feeling homesick, so they cooked Pakistani food together. My son wanted the whole family to eat this food, because he said it would make the boy feel like he and his culture were accepted by the whole family.

Now, I don't like Middle Eastern food. I don't like strong spices. My son begged me to just try some of it, or to at least eat the bread they made. The bread had flecks of all kinds of weird spices on it though, so I refused. My son got mad and asked me to please eat something just to ""make your grandson happy."" He pulled me aside for this, so the boy wasn't present to hear our conversation.

I told my son that I have no proof he is my grandson, and even if I did, I shouldn't have to eat food I don't like. My son called me a selfish, stubborn A and then asked me to leave. So, I did. My wife stayed though.

My wife agrees with me that I shouldn't have to eat food I don't like, but she said I could have at least tried a bite to appease our son. She thinks I was just being stubborn to be stubborn. I wasn't though. I don't like Middle Eastern food, that's all. How can I be the A for that? Still, my son isn't speaking to me right now.

s5x6i4,"I went to look at the catholicism sub, and a hot thread over there concerns modesty and the double standard for men and women. My thoughts were:

Where do they find the time to care about what other people are wearing? When I think about Christianity, it asks so much of you. Life is short and they believe they have the keys to eternity and communion with the creator of the universe. Then they go and worry about some woman wearing a bikini and what the supreme being thinks about that, as well as what this supreme being thinks about other people's thoughts about the bikini. 

I realise that by making this post, I'm also wasting time on something inconsequential, in that I'm worrying about other people wasting time worrying about unimportant things, but I don't believe my eternal soul and the entire universe is in the balance like they do, so I can waste time.

It's so North American on that sub. Anyone who's been to continental Europe in the summer will get what I mean. I know I sound snobby when I say this, but I speak from experience.

Not limited to that sub, but I feel like they have never spoken to someone who is gay or bi about human sexuality. It's the same stuff I've seen and heard hundreds of times: men are visually attracted to this and that and women are attracted to status - pop-science flavoured stuff. Funnily enough, you also see this a lot from sexist internet atheists and redpilled types. 

I feel like people have gone backwards in terms of understanding sexuality since psychoanalysis fell out of favour. (I'm not arguing that psychoanalysis is great, just that it has a more nuanced understanding of sexuality than what we see here.)

They take sexualisation and objectification ostensibly out of the political realm by making it a theological issue. I said ostensibly because religion is political too, but they focus on the wrong things. The way people treat each other because of their bodies and how they dress is political. Instead of worrying about whether it's healthy or fair to have these double standards, they worry about whether it's a sin or not.

Finally, it's all so strange to me after being lapsed for so long. I can't believe how much time I spent worrying about sinning just by having a body, and having other people look at it and having thoughts about other people's bodies. It's madness.",Modesty - your thoughts?,2.0,2.0

##This round is for matches 25 to 32 on the bracket. Make sure to double check to see if you‚Äôre in this one!

***

After escaping some crazy dangerous circumstances, you can truly begin your quest unimpeded by ill fate. It's time to take this quest seriously. In fact, you've even gotten a hot tip from someone as you explore the various worlds.

Legends speak of an individual who, using incredible strength, will, and ideals, managed to summon Kingdom Hearts, and with its blessings, they were given the power to make all of their desires come true.

This person has been dead for a few decades now.

Your lead, immediately snatched away. But what if it wasn't? What if there was a way to speak to this figure, and gain their knowledge? There is. You only need to visit...

#[Tierre de la Muerte](https://i.imgur.com/X1ubVKn.png)

The Land of the Dead. The resting place of all spirits, for people to remember until they can't any longer. The living aren't supposed to be here, and yet you venture onwards anyway. Your goal is simple. Find this legend, learn anything you can about Kingdom Hearts, and leave well rewarded.

Unfortunately, things aren't that simple. For this land holds a special rule. All those who remain in this land when the sun rises become permanent residents. What does this mean for your team? Instant death.

It may be midnight now, but with no clue where to start looking, another team lurking somewhere else in this world (potentially looking to get that same information before you, potentially looking to entrap you in this world), and the dead around you quite uneased by your presence, you fear the dawn will arrive faster than you anticipate. Better get a move on!

***

##Scramble Rules

**That‚Äôs Sora, Donald, and Goofy Too!:** Every participant this season received three characters on their team, but many of them might not be a household name. To aid with readability, please give a brief summary of your characters, with enough information so the average reader can get excited for your team before starting.

**Let Your Heart Be Your Guiding Key:** Your write up will depict a scenario where your team is the victor. Even if your team has a one in a million chance of overcoming the odds, show what they‚Äôd need to do to come out on top against the challenge in front of them!

**Unlocking Limit Form:** Writers are allowed to make changes to their characters in their narrative to fit their story, such as allowing power stealers to gain more powers, teaching martial artists new techniques, or having characters gradually grow in strength between rounds. However, you are not beholden to following what your opponent is doing. When facing another team, you are only required to write their characters as they were submitted. This is to help with ease of research, and make things more fun for both sides.

***

##Round Rules

**Guest Starring:** *The Living Dead!* The guest is a denizen of this underworld, which means they've been dead for a while now. How does that look? Are they a vengeful spirit destined to keep you here past sunrise for intruding on their world? A spirit animal that helps guide you where you need to go? In fact, is the legend, the person you're looking for, the guest themselves? There's a decent variety of options here, so go with what fits your run best!

**Setting:** Preparing for the Day of the Dead, this world is a sight to behold. Skeletons walk around as people would on cobblestone roads, the houses begin decrepit, but as you venture deeper, grow more rich, more ordained, into grand mansions for the famous, the elite, the *remembered*. The colors of the various plazas, vibrant neon greens and pinks. Stands placed on every corner to sell some trinket or another. Music blares as you walk, festive Spanish songs played by the residents that celebrate life, and of course, death. In a land this big, it'll be like finding a needle in a haystack. May as well enjoy the sights while you're looking around.

**Key Points:** The key points of the round are the following. Your team is looking for a ""dead"" person to gain information from them on how to attain their overall goal, while the other team is trying to stop you, or gain that information before you. This quest for information has a time limit. The guest must figure into this in some way.

**Post Limit:** For this round, writers will be limited to **8 posts, or 80k characters**. While it is fine to go a little bit over, anything that far surpasses this limit will be automatically disqualified. This limit does not include intro posts, or analysis of the matchup. Use your best judgement, if you think your story is too long for the round, it probably is.

**Due Date:** Write ups will be due at 10PM EST on **January 30th**. That‚Äôs slightly over two weeks, so manage your time well!

***

#Flavor Suggestions

**People Die When They Are Killed:** Perhaps your story isn't fantastical in nature, and speaking to a long dead person is out of the cards. As some suggested alternatives, the death could be metaphorical. Perhaps the person you're looking for is only presumed dead and changed their identity, or they're a hero who has long since retired, their other identity being ""dead"" in a sense. There‚Äôs plenty of ways to weave the theme of death into the story without getting literal, so get creative!

**Chain of Memories:** In the actual film, ""Coco,"" the spirits exist in this world as long as someone remembers them. Is there anyone your team members lost in their past that they cared for? How would they react to the possibility of seeing them again? Would they even want to see them again?",Character Scramble 15 Round 2: Remember Me,2.0,2.0

ayt3l9,"Don't mean to be a Wendy or a Dicky Anders but I think I could make a pretty solid case for why the dog going ""Hmm?"" is the worst joke Ricky has ever made.

I've gotten 10 minutes in and I cannot watch anymore, it's just too embarrassing. The comedy is clearly not about the characters like in Office or Extras (to an extent), instead it's just shitty Americanised one liners where it doesn't matter who is saying them, they're just piffy jokes except in this case it's ""edgy"" shit... Edgy shit's alright in the pub but when a 60 year old millionaire trying to recapture lightning in a bottle, oneup Karl and with makeup on and hair dye is saying it to 30 cameras all around him (which you're aware of because no realism is created when a dog is fucking reading a gravestone) it's just embarrassing.

Like, tubby fat cunt could be said by Chandler Bing, Sheldon Cooper, Charlie Harper etc. and the joke would be just as effective because it's just a very flat, 2 dimensional joke whereas even just a look at the camera from Brent is so much more unique. There's no other character that can do a look at the camera like that and make it work so well.

&#x200B;

**Tubby fat cunt though! He says cunt! To a kid!!! HA!!!**

&#x200B;

I didn't find Derek that funny either but I think that can be taken a bit more seriously and Ricky pretending to be a mental was really good but what's he doing here? This series is literally Ricky's ego in a show, he's got so big now that it's like nothing he does is going to be received poorly because of all the thick kids watching.

&#x200B;

**Thank you to everyone who are still commenting about Humanity, love you all!**

&#x200B;

He did a similar thing with Humanity, rather than the timeless Noah jokes and the animals talking to each other, he just reads his Twitter fueds and tries to be offensive... ""pay for my chemotherapy"" not that funny, silly one liner, 3dgy

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Just to people who are going to defend the show and Ricky, here are my general responses:

1. I love(d) Ricky. He was very funny on XFM from his bits in series 0, his digs at Karl, his little remarks ""little monkey legs"" and Office and that, it goes without saying. Just Hilarious
2. I'm not just a hipster, I wasn't sure about Alan's new series either but I'm loving that.
3. I think Steve is doing a similar thing, just selling out to America - he's already pretty shitty now
4. Ricky, the king of edgyness, Gervais now bans people who comment negatively about him on his Facebook.

s7u6ox,"Hi all. I get if this post will receive hate, but I just feel the need to say something. I, probably like nearly all of you, initially found Chrystal and Chuck's channels and was immediately weirded out yet intrigued by them. I'm all for oddball/cringe channels to watch, and I won't lie have seen probably all of their videos. I've followed all the 'drama' and 'controversies,' and I understand the scope of their bad parenting, bad political takes, her eating disorder etc. However as time has passed, I've come to think that they are both just pretty autistic/sheltered adults that can barely function, and I feel bad getting any laughs at their expense. 

Obviously they have made bad decisions and deserve SOME criticism......but idk. They can barely speak in full sentences. Chuck is more of a mystery because he is allegedly well-educated and has some intellectual interests, yet can't eat properly, take care of himself, or seem to understand what his wife is going through and help her AT ALL. They clearly have very real mental issues, and I was wondering if you all share these thoughts?

I'm sure I'm one of many testing positive on a RAT during their much needed Christmas break from work, effectively giving no time to recharge. All thanks to the Let It Rip strategy which couldn't have come at a worse time for all tax payers..I'm wondering if you can receive Corona payments (I'm in Vic) for a positive RAT? If so, I'm inclined to save my RAT for a rainy day and take a week off for my mental health during Jan or Feb. Might sound dodgy but I've been working for 2 years straight without a break and without govt support. I need this for my mental health. Desperately. I think it's only fair we get an appropriate break and if it takes a loophole to get it, so be it.

s76ket,"Why is it, that out of all the groups I have been in, anarchists (or at least those who post here) tend to be the most politically correct? Isn't the whole idea of anarchism freedom, diversity and no power structures? Being politically correct seems like brainwash to me. What awaits you in the end is a mind that can't think for itself.

Inclusion is fine and all, but I am not looking for a world where everyone acts the same way, where everyone is under control. I care for my freedom of speech even if it potentially includes hate speech. I am not a hateful person myself, but I don't really care if anyone is. I have had about as many people who whole heartedly hate me as friends. If they feel that way, fine. Shouldn't this be the default? In the end, you can always avoid being hateful yourself and if anyone else is, their loss.

Ableism, racism, fascism and other ""fun"" isms seem to be the sole topic of this group. Shouldn't freedom of speech, digital freedom and other topics concerning freedom be on top? I don't want a society where everyone who says something ""out of line"" is inmediately cancelled and never forgiven. I have a few problems with those isms being discussed so often. 

1) People will call anything ____ism. Is not selling vegetables at a butchery considered discriminatory? Is not selling gentle soap considered ableist? 

2) Strictly following these ever stricter rules seems like freedom restriction. I don't want that.

3) While speaking about such topics, topics imo far more interesting and urgent are getting left behind. I am now talking about how Meta (Zuck) is soon going to have a monopole on reality. I am talking about how media and the press are being manipulated by the government (worldwide). I am talking about how China has almost removed freedom altogether from the state. These are topics that are soon going to concern us too.

4) In trying to be inclusive, you are actually being only more exclusive. You are pointing out the differences. Who cares? Shouldn't we focus on what makes us either similar or completely unique?

Let me explain my standpoint of view: I categorise the whole world into 2 categories. Those who I care about and those I don't. If I care about someone, it isn't because they are black, gay or autistic. It is because they are nice to me and are interesting to talk to. If I care about someone, I don't care what makes us different, I only care what makes us closer. I couldn't care less if all my friends were gay, black or any minor thing. (To be clear, I don't care that I am any other minority.)
