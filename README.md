# The Look of Hate on Reddit

---
## Introduction
The goal of this project is to investigate details of hateful language on Reddit with an emphasis on gender. We wanted to know: what does this language looks like? Which terms are popular? Whether it has a gender imbalance--is it more prevalent in comments with references to female identifiers as opposed to comments with male identifiers?

## Method
Below are the steps we followed to complete the project

--
#### Hate definition research
The initial portion of the work involved understanding academic definitions of hate. There is not a definitive agreement about what constitutes hate speech or where the boundary exists between hate speech and offensive language. Different people will have different judgments. From this research, we obtained the classifier used to label comments as either hateful, offensive or neither (Davidson, Warmsley, Macy, & Weber, 2017). Part of this research was to developed a list of terms found in hateful speech, which was also largely from Davidson and colleagues (2017), but was ammended with terms from other research. 
The list `hate_terms` was then used to retrieve data from Reddit's API. 

#### Data acquisition
The criteria for our data acquisition, then, was to scrape all comments created in January 2022 so long as they contain at least one of the terms in the hate_terms list.
There are different levels of moderation on Reddit, so to avoid working with survival data, we used data archived by Pushshift. Pushshift tends to retrieve Reddit data immediately after creation, which atenuates our risk of missing removed comments. 

One consequence of Pushshift's promptness is that some metrics, such as score and controversiality, have not yet accumulated data. So in addition, we also scraped some metrics for those comments in March 2022.
In addition to the comments, we scraped the original submission for each comment, and the user who created each submission. Both of these were scraped directly from Reddit's API.

Yet another data we acquired was a reference dataset. Given the overly imbalanced gender distribution of our primary dataset, we wanted to compare distribution of our comments.csv with the gender distribution of all Reddit. Since we cannot scrape comments at random, we opted to retrieve the first 70 comments created every hour of every day in January 2022 without filtering for terms. The result was a raw dataset containing 52000+ comments, which approximates to one quarter of our primary dataset.

#### Data processing
Reddit is infamous for having copious amounts of spam. We acknowledge that spams, especially for sexually oriented subreddits, may contain hateful/toxic language, but given its abundance, spams would have overwhelmed our analysis and skewed results. So we opted for a simple strategy. We dropped duplicate comments, comments made by bots, and comments from the most prolific spammer--7000+ comments containing links to the same porn subreddit.

Additional data processing:
* Date conversion from unix
* Classification into Davidson label categories (hate/offensive/neither) (Davidson, Warmsley, Macy, & Weber, 2017)
* Gender classification (using lists of gender identifiers that we researched and developed)
* Detoxify classification
* Filter out comments in foreign languages

#### Research Questions
We developed numerous research questions -- and the number grew as the project progressed. We did not tackle all of them for this first phase of the project. The research questions are in ResearchQuestions.pdf. This document includes some project information as well as research questions, operationalized versions of the questions, some notes on statistical methods, and hypotheses.

In this phase of the project we addressed research questions 1-9, 11, and 15 - 17.

Each notebook is named using the research question numbers. If multiple questions are analyzed in one notebook, an underscore separates the question numbers. For example, Q11_15.ipynb examines research questions 11 and 15. The notebooks include the research question, operationalized question, hypothesis, and a brief description of the results in a section above the coding for each question. Visualizations are included amid the coding.

## Reproducibility

This project is still in development so some things will be simplified and refined in the near future.<br/>
